This ad leads the viewer from the words MEET ALEX etc straight to the boy and then over and down to the girl. I didnât even notice there was a set of parenthesis with words in them in the ad until I looked the fourth time.Â </p>\n<p>This is a fallacious confirmation bias, as anyone looking at it will assume Alex is the focal point (i.e. The Boy) and then if theyâre perceptive theyâll notice the words at the bottom. Aha! Those damn gender stereotypes gotcha again! Except no, because the ad literally forces you to read it as âAlex is the boyâ by the visual language and lines of sight.Â </p>\n<p>A better ad would have been structured from top to bottom instead of left to right, and wouldnât have pushed the girl, the real subject of the ad (who, by the way, has been VISUALLY PUSHED OUT OF HER RIGHTFUL SPACE ON THE AD BY HER BROTHER) off to the corner as far away from her identifiers as possible.Â </p>\n<p>Here, Iâll make you a better ad.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"image\" src=\"http://38.media.tumblr.com/92f34a6085124d4eb55f8c7829e3df87/tumblr_inline_ndd2eba6jq1r3ylr6.png\"/></p>\n<p>Bam. Shitty stock photo but you get the point. If anyone sees<em> this</em> and assumes Alex is the boy, they donât have the the ad layout to use as an excuse for their internalized gender shittery. Likewise, the ad isnât actively trying to make you read it a certain way and THEN making you feel guilty for interpreting it the way they designed it to be.Â </p>\n</blockquote>",
