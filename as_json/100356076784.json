   "quote-text" : "Do you have a name?â asked Gerta.<br/>\n            âI do,â said the raven.<br/>\n            Gerta waited.<br/>\n            The raven fluffed its beard. âI am the Sound of Mouse Bones Crunching Under the Hooves of God.â<br/>\n            Gerta blinked a few times. âThatâsâ¦quite a name.â<br/>\n            âI made it myself,â said the raven, preening. âI stole the very shiniest words and hoarded them all up until they made something worth having. Sound and God were particularly well-guarded. Crunching I found in a squirrel nest, though.â<br/>\n            âMay I call you Mousebones?â asked Gerta. âItâsâ¦a lot to say all at once.â<br/>\n            It was hard for a creature with a beak to scowl, but the raven managed, mostly with the skin around its eyes. âI suppose,â it said. âIf you must.â<br/>\n            âMineâs Gerta,â said Gerta.<br/>\n            âThereâs your problem right there,â said Mousebones. âMuch too short and not enough in it. I donât know how you expect to become anything more than you are, with a name like that.",
