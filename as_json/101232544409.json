   "quote-text" : "The team at NASA was finally able to take a closer look, and have now concluded that there is in fact a 2,500-square-mile cloud of methaneâroughly the size of Delawareâfloating over the Four Corners region, where the borders of Arizona, Colorado, New Mexico, and Utah all intersect. A report published by the NASA researchers in the journal Geophysical Research Letters concludes that âthe source is likely from established gas, coal, and coalbed methane mining and processing.â Indeed, the hot spot happens to be above New Mexicoâs San Juan Basin, the most productive coalbed methane basin in North America.",
