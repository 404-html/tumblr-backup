   "quote-text" : "You tossed a blanket from the bed,<br/>\nYou lay upon your back, and waited;<br/>\nYou dozed, and watched the night revealing<br/>\nThe thousand sordid images<br/>\nOf which your soul was constituted;<br/>\nThey flickered against the ceiling.<br/>\nAnd when all the world came back<br/>\nAnd the light crept up between the shutters<br/>\nAnd you heard the sparrows in the gutters,<br/>\nYou had such a vision of the street<br/>\nAs the street hardly understands;<br/>\nSitting along the bed&rsquo;s edge, where<br/>\nYou curled the papers from your hair,<br/>\nOr clasped the yellow soles of feet<br/>\nIn the palms of both soiled hands."
