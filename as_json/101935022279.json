Â We are one of the few democracies, for example, that requires people to register to vote. Â Most elsewhere,Â <a href=\"http://www.minnpost.com/eric-black-ink/2014/10/why-turnout-so-low-us-elections-we-make-it-more-difficult-vote-other-democrac\">writes</a>Â Eric Black for the Minnesota Post:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[G]overnments know the names, ages and addresses of most of its citizens andâ¦Â provide the appropriate polling place with a list of those qualified to vote. The voter just has to show up.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>We also hold elections on just one day instead of several and that day is an otherwise normal Tuesday instead of a weekendÂ or a holiday.</p>\n<p>Those are just two examples of rules and practicesÂ that reduceÂ voting. There are many. Itâs calledÂ <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voter_suppression_in_the_United_States\"><em>voter suppression</em></a>Â and itâs totally a thing. The ACLU has collected voter suppression efforts justÂ sinceÂ 2013, listingÂ <a href=\"https://www.aclu.org/maps/battle-protect-ballot-voter-suppression-measures-passed-2013\">15 states that have passed such measures</a>.</p>\n<p>A majorityÂ of these efforts to reduce voting are initiated by the political right, as aÂ <a href=\"https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&amp;ion=1&amp;espv=2&amp;ie=UTF-8#q=republicans%20democrats%20more%20likely%20voter%20suppression\">generic search</a>Â for such stories quickly reveals. They are aimed specifically at likely democratic voters, likeÂ racial minorities and students, adding up to what political scientist David SchultzÂ <a href=\"http://america.aljazeera.com/opinions/2014/10/2014-midterm-electionsgopvotersuppressiondemocrats.html\">argues</a>Â is the Second Great Disenfranchisement in U.S. history after Jim Crow.</p>\n<p>Many of these measures are overtly discriminatory and even illegal, but others are more subtle. Making voting more costly in terms of time might be one subtle way of discouraging voting by some types of people. Data collected by theÂ <a href=\"https://www.supportthevoter.gov/files/2013/08/Waiting-to-Vote-in-2012-Stewart.pdf\">Cooperative Congressional Election Study</a>Â in 2012 suggests that this is, indeed, part of voter suppression, by incompetence or design.</p>\n<p>Here is some of their data.</p>\n<p>Nationwide, the average wait time to vote was longer for all non-white groups, especially blacks (see graph above).Â Florida had the longest delays in 2012 and these delays disproportionately affected Latinos:</p>\n<p><a class=\"shutterset_64815\" href=\"http://thesocietypages.org/socimages/files/2014/11/3.png\"><img alt=\"3\" class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-64818\" height=\"286\" src=\"http://thesocietypages.org/socimages/files/2014/11/3-500x286.png\" width=\"500\"/></a></p>\n<p>In South Carolina, the 10 precinctsÂ with the longest wait times were all in one disproportionately African American county:</p>\n<p><a class=\"shutterset_64815\" href=\"http://thesocietypages.org/socimages/files/2014/11/4.png\"><img alt=\"4\" class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-64819\" height=\"285\" src=\"http://thesocietypages.org/socimages/files/2014/11/4-500x285.png\" width=\"500\"/></a></p>\n<p>Wait times are partly the result of the number of voting machines divided by the number of registered voters. The long wait times in South Carolina, in other words, were not random. Those 10 precincts in the highly African American county had about half as many voting machines per person as the statewide average:</p>\n<p><a class=\"shutterset_64815\" href=\"http://thesocietypages.org/socimages/files/2014/11/5.png\"><img alt=\"5\" class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-64820\" height=\"301\" src=\"http://thesocietypages.org/socimages/files/2014/11/5-500x301.png\" width=\"500\"/></a></p>\n<p>They also had significantly fewer poll workers available to help out:</p>\n<p><a class=\"shutterset_64815\" href=\"http://thesocietypages.org/socimages/files/2014/11/6.png\"><img alt=\"6\" class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-64821\" height=\"304\" src=\"http://thesocietypages.org/socimages/files/2014/11/6-500x304.png\" width=\"500\"/></a></p>\n<p>There are more graphs and more details atÂ <a href=\"http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2014/10/charts-black-latino-voters-machines-poll-workers\"><em>Mother Jones</em></a>.</p>\n<p>Voter suppression seriously harms our right to call ourselves a democracy. Â Notably,Â itâs significantly worse today. When the Supreme Court struck down the part of the Voting Rights Act that required oversight of states with a history of voting discrimination, the ability of the federal government to ensure equal voting rights was seriously damaged. Previously monitored statesÂ <a href=\"http://bigstory.ap.org/article/states-promise-quick-action-after-voting-ruling\">immediately began passing legislation</a>Â designed to suppress voting. As I wroteÂ <a href=\"http://thesocietypages.org/socimages/2013/07/01/history-repeating-itself-discriminatory-voting-laws-then-now/\">previously</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>This is bad. Â It will be much more difficult toÂ <em>undoÂ </em>discriminatory laws than it was toÂ <em>preventÂ </em>them from being implemented and, even if they are challenged and overturned, they will do damage in the meantime.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong><span class=\"ft_signature\">Lisa Wade is a professor of sociology atÂ <a href=\"http://lisa-wade.com/\">Occidental College</a>Â and the co-author ofÂ <a href=\"http://books.wwnorton.com/books/detail.aspx?ID=4294986320\">Gender: Ideas, Interactions, Institutions</a>.
