Money is external.<br/>\nHe is learning, well behind his desperate eyes,<br/>\nThe epistemology of loss, how to stand up<br/>\nKnowing what every man must one day know<br/>\nAnd most know many days, how to stand up<br/>\nAnd gradually light returns to the street,<br/>\nA whistle blows, the ball is out of sight.",
