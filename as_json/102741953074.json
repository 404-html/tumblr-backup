   "quote-text" : "<p>In case you donât watch Fox, you should know that they work extremely hard to find excuses to put images of scantily clad women on the air. Some of it contains no finger-wagging â how about a report on Hootersâ third-quarter profits, with lots of shots of waitresses? â but plenty of it is presented with a thin veneer of moral condemnation that allows viewers to feel like Fox remains on their side in the grand battle against sexual depravity. My favorite example has to be the time Sean Hannity presented hard-hitting journalism on what goes on at Spring Break, spread out over an entire weekâs worth of stories with endless shots of girls in bikinis. Somehow, the Peabody committee overlooked Hannityâs scoop that kids are drinking and having sex in Ft. Lauderdale.</p>\n\n<p>You can think of this as a betrayal of its audienceâs cultural conservatism, but I think itâs actually a form of service. In a way, Fox News knows its viewers better than they know themselves. Donât forget that the typical Fox viewer is a conservative senior citizen. The median age of the networkâs viewers is 68.8, and some shows skew even older; Bill OâReillyâs median viewer is 72. More so than perhaps any other channel on television, Fox endeavors to shape and reflect not just its viewersâ beliefs about particular topics but their entire worldview. It presents a picture of the world in which everything is going hell, and the prime enemies are change and modernity. The president hates America, immigrants are destroying our culture, the kids are out of control, and itâs not like it was back in the day. Fox is a channel for the conservative id, where you can have your darkest thoughts and worst fears nurtured and validated.</p>\n\n<p>And of course, thereâs nothing the id likes better than looking at half-naked girls.</p>",
