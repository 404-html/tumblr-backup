   "quote-text" : "So a little arrogance (or even a lot) isn&rsquo;t such a bad thing, although your mother undoubtedly told you different. Mine did. <em>Pride goeth before a fall, Stephen</em>, she said &hellip; and then I found out &ndash; right around the age that is 19 x 2 &ndash; that eventually you fall down, anyway. Or get pushed into the ditch. At nineteen they can card you in the bars and tell you to get the fuck out, put your sorry act (and sorrier ass) back on the street, but they can&rsquo;t card you when you sit down to pain a picture, write a poem, or tell a story, by God, and if you reading this happen to be very young, don&rsquo;t let your elders and supposed betters tell you any different. Sure, you&rsquo;ve never been to Paris. No, you never ran with the bulls at Pamplona. Yes, you&rsquo;re a pissant who had no hair in your armpits until three years ago &ndash; but so what? If you don&rsquo;t start out too big for your britches, how are you gonna fill &lsquo;em when you grow up? Let it rip regardless of what anybody tells you, that&rsquo;s my idea; sit down and <em>smoke</em> that baby.",
