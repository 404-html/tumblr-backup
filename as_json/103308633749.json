   "quote-text" : "It really is crazy that the word âfeministâ can have negative connotations in 2014. It upsets me that the younger generation of women think itâs a dirty word, and associate it with a kind of militantism or a sense of female superiority. Itâs not. It just means liberation, and equality.",
