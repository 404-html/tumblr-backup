Iâm Tina, a recent graduate in Biological Anthropology form the University of Cambridge. My research focuses on the evolution of human hair diversity - something which is severely under-researched, despite the fact that its one of the most visibly varying traits we humans have!Â </p>\n<p>I was offered a place to do my PhD at Cambridge, but alas, funding did not come through. I will reapply Cambridge, but Iâve also spoken to some really amazing Professors at Penn State and Harvard University whoâve encouraged me to apply to their graduate programs and work with them on this project, but I simply cannot afford the cost of applications before the deadlines , so I am crowdfunding over the next 10 days (<a href=\"http://spsr.me/1zCilDL\">check it out</a>).Â </p>\n<p>My bachelorâs thesis was entitled<em> Human Hair Diversity: Quantitative variation of hair fibre shape and pigmentation.Â </em>The department liked it and awarded it a Starred First (82) and my supervisor and I are working on a publication for a peer-reviewed journal based on this research right now. I ended up finding a lot of interesting things that Iâm dying to share with you all! (And hopefully I will be able to share that publication with you all in a few months)</p>\n<p>To keep it brief, Iâm interested in answering questions such as:</p>\n<ul><li><span>Why did humans evolve such a wide range of hair textures and colours?</span></li>\n<li><span>Do certain textures/colours provide an evolutionary advantage?</span></li>\n<li><span>Why did humans lose all their body hair but keep their scalp hair?</span></li>\n</ul><p>My BA thesis is a step in the right direction, but having the opportunity to dedicate an entire PhD to this would bring this field out of the dark ages. And I do not exaggerate when I say that, a lot of studies published in scientific journals will describe hair in categories such as âwavyâ, âwoollyâ, âblondâ âredâ despite the fact that we have the methods to describe the detailed morphology and chemically structure of hair - and using these methods would be a much more objective approach to studying it!</p>\n<p>But unfortunately, a lot of researchers use categories like the ones described above, or even worse they will divide hair into: âAfricanâ, âAsianâ and âEuropeanâ hair, completely ignoring anyone who does not fall into those categories and completely homogenizing the massive numbers of populations which fall within these vast geographic regions.</p>\n<p>Answering questions about human hair diversity is part of understanding human phenotypic variation - essentially, itâs part of understanding why we look different. I plan to make sure the public can access and understand all of the work that I do + any relevant information on the evolution of human (hair) diversity through my <a href=\"http://spsr.me/1zCilDL\">website</a>.</p>\n<p>If any of this sounds interesting to you, thereâs even more info on the website <a href=\"http://humanhairdiversity.com/\">humanhairdiversity.com</a> and I will be using the hashtag #HairEvolutionPhD across platforms, follow me on Tumblr, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/tealass22\">Twitter</a>, <a href=\"http://instagram.com/tealass22\">Instagram </a>and <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/humanhairdiversity\">Facebook </a>to hear more about it. And I would really appreciate it if you can support the campaign in any way you can, since I need to reach a minimum ofÂ <span>Â£430 by the end (or I receive nothing), I can assure you that every little bit helps immensely! So, here is the <a href=\"http://spsr.me/1zCilDL\">crowdfunding page</a> again.</span></p>\n<p><span>Thanks for reading!</span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>SIGNAL BOOST</p>\n<p>you guys this is so cool! help a girl out!</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>OVER 9000?!?!<br/><br/>I donât even understand how the physics of the interwebs have allowed for this!!<br/><br/>Thank you so much guys!!</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Ever think âI wish there was some way I could support innovative research done by awesome women in STEMâ?
