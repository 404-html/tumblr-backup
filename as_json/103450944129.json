I recently learned this.Â </p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Everyone should know these things.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>thanks to mainstream media and being unable to show breasts on TV, way too few people know about female signs of cardiac distress, and impending heart attacks. they only know about the âpain in the left armâ male symptom.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>i had all these symptoms once and they sent me right to hospital</p>\n<p>it was scary bc i didnt know these were the symptoms for female heart issues</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Please, please,Â <strong>PLEASE,Â </strong>reblog this. i donât know if I did save or called false alarm, with my bossâ life tonight. I felt I was being a bit paranoid, overreacting, but I told Mirage my thoughts and he, after reading over the article I showed him, immediately sprung into action and then shooed her off to the hospital. I donât know if I did or not, but I knew sheâd been super stressed. Sheâd off-handedly commented on her arm tingling and I asked her if she felt queasy on a hunch. I went to look at the symptoms and we went from there.</p>\n</blockquote>",
