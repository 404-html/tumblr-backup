   "answer" : "<p>Of course hon! Check out the posts on myÂ <a href=\"http://thejunglenook.tumblr.com/search/book+recommendations\">Book Recommendations</a>Â page for previous posts (from myself and others) on this topic.Â </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Disclaimer: While I much prefer to read every book before I recommend it to others, this is not always possible. This Ethologist doesnât get paid enough to support her book addiction, but I keep adding to these sorts of lists in the hopes that Iâll slowly be able to add them to my library (or at least check them out). That being said, if anyone has any additional recommendations or constructive comments on the titles listed here, please let me know.Â </p>\n</blockquote>\n<ol><li>Anything byÂ <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/David-Attenborough/e/B000APV342\">David Attenborough<br/></a>I believe I listed some specific titles in previous posts, but really you canât go wrong with Sir David.<br/><br/></li>\n<li>Anything byÂ <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Frans-De-Waal/e/B000APOHE0/ref=sr_tc_2_0?qid=1415592299&amp;sr=1-2-ent\">Frans De Waal</a><br/>I was required to readÂ <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Our-Inner-Ape-Primatologist-Explains/dp/1594481962/ref=asap_B000APOHE0_1_5?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1415586046&amp;sr=1-5\">Our Inner Ape</a>Â as a part of a freshman general science course, and it opened me up to the world of Ethology (and that I could actuallyÂ <em>get paid</em>Â to do this)! I have a number of his books and they are educational while still being accessible and entertaining to scientists and general public alike.Â <br/><br/></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/The-Primate-Mind-Built-Connect/dp/0674058046\">The Primate Mind: Built to Connect with Other Minds</a><br/>Frans De Waal andÂ Pier Francesco Ferrari (editors) compiled works from Ethologists, Psychologists, Neuroscientists, and Primatologists to look at primate social behavior from multiple perspectives. I havenât read this yet but am a huge nerd for a number of the contributing authors included in this book. Letâs just say this one is high up on my Christmas list.<br/><br/></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Handbook-Ethological-Methods-Philip-Lehner/dp/0521637503/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1415593694&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=9780521637503\">The Handbook of Ethological Methods</a>Â - Philip N. Lehner<br/>Although dated, this hefty text is the knock-down-drag-out best reference to break down (and familiarize yourself with) animal behavior and ethological research. The hefty price tag has kept it out of my personal library, but Iâve curled up in a library carrel with this text a number of times.<br/><br/></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Animal-Intelligence-Individual-Social-Cognition/dp/0521532027\">Animal Intelligence: From Individual to Social CognitionÂ </a>-Â ZhannaÂ Reznikova<br/>This book covers a multitude of species in the wild and in the lab. Itâs another (potentially) hefty price tag but the accessible language and wide subjectÂ breadthÂ should make it a well worth investment to most readers.<br/><br/></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Among-African-Apes-Stories-Photos/dp/0520274598/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1415594509&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=AMONG+AFRICAN+APES%3A+STORIES+AND+PHOTOS+FROM+THE+FIELD\">Among African Apes: Stories and Photos from the Field</a>Â <br/>MarthaÂ Robbins andÂ ChristopheÂ BoeschÂ Â (editors) go beyond the (much beloved) household name of Jane Goodall and get stories from ape researchers still working in the field. The first-hand accounts share the breakthroughs, joys, frustrations, and challenges of field work.Â </li>\n</ol><p>Have your own Ethology must reads?
