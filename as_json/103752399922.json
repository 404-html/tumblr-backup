   "quote-text" : "&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve made plenty of friends here in the last few months,&rdquo; said Hewitt, reportedly doing his best to hide his congested voice so as not to alert his mother that he recently caught a cold. &ldquo;I hang out with them all the time. We go out together and do all sorts of stuff. I&rsquo;m definitely having a lot of fun.&rdquo; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m doing fine,&rdquo; Hewitt added. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m really fine.&rdquo; Rather than explain that he spent the past weekend alone in his apartment sleeping until the late afternoon and then playing video games, Hewitt went on to say that he has &ldquo;been seeing all the sights in Boston,&rdquo; claiming that he has already visited a museum and that he went to a Bruins game the other week.",
