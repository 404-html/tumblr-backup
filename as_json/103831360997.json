He was asked if he had been campaigning to expel Christians from his neighbourhood. He seemed puzzled for a moment, then rebuked: &#8220;This is a Muslim country, Allah has given it to us. If these Christians make noise at the time of our prayers, then they should be asked to leave.&#8221; I am certain that even when Chishti was stuffing pages from the Qur&#8217;an in the poor girl&#8217;s trash bag, he believed he was doing Allah&#8217;s work.",
