He was asked if he had been campaigning to expel Christians from his neighbourhood. He seemed puzzled for a moment, then rebuked: &ldquo;This is a Muslim country, Allah has given it to us. If these Christians make noise at the time of our prayers, then they should be asked to leave.&rdquo; I am certain that even when Chishti was stuffing pages from the Qur'an in the poor girl&rsquo;s trash bag, he believed he was doing Allah&rsquo;s work.",
