   "quote-text" : "A few days before it was found that Chishti had planted evidence against Rimsha, he was interviewed on TV. He was asked if he had been campaigning to expel Christians from his neighbourhood. He seemed puzzled for a moment, then rebuked: &#8220;This is a Muslim country, Allah has given it to us. If these Christians make noise at the time of our prayers, then they should be asked to leave.&#8221; I am certain that even when Chishti was stuffing pages from the Qur&#8217;an in the poor girl&#8217;s trash bag, he believed he was doing Allah&#8217;s work.",
