   "photo-caption" : "<p>Welp, that was a fun game. I played the Austrians with a large peninsula of my own: India was to my south and served as a useful buffer, but the real win of the game was being <em>surrounded</em> by city states on my peninsula. Being Austria, my superpower was the ability to incorporate city states into my empire through marriage: I got through the entire game without attacking a single non-Barbarian unit, as enough city states were within reach to fuel all my expansion that way. I started focusing on a Space Victory at around turn 350, while keeping an eye on defense so that my waring neighbors (nearly all of them were at war for most of the last 150 turns) &ndash; but I made my final spaceship component nine turns too late. Le sigh.</p>",
