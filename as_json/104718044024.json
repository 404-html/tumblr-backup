It was a favorite activity and one that allowed him to shut out the troubles of the world, if only for a little while.</p>\n<p>The telephone rang, and the White House operator put through the call. Franklin D. Roosevelt learned that the Japanese had attacked Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, just before 8 a.m. Hawaii time (1 p.m. in Washington).</p>\n<p>It was still unclear what the loss was in lives and ships and planes, but it would be high. Hawaii was the home of the Pacific fleet, along with thousands of soldiers and sailors to man them.</p>\n<p>Two of Rooseveltâs speechwriters were out of town, so the President summoned his secretary, Grace Tully, to take down dictation as he âdraftedâ one of the most famous speeches of the 20th century to deliver to Congress the next day.</p>\n<p>âYesterday, December seventh, 1941, a date which will live in world history,â he began, âthe United States was simultaneously and deliberately attacked by naval and air forces of the empire of Japan.â</p>\n<p>Slowly and carefully, he dictated the rest of the speech, and Tully typed up the first draft for his review.</p>\n<p>We know, of course, that when FDR finished his wordsmithing of the speech that the first line, the one best remembered, turned out a little different: âYesterday, December 7, 1941, a date which will live in infamy, the United States of America was suddenly and deliberately attacked by the naval and air forces of the Empire of Japan.â</p>\n<p>Prologue, the Quarterly of the National Archives, takes you through the various drafts of FDRâs so-called âDay of Infamyâ speech, with images of pages with his hand-written changes in wording and updates on Japanese attacks on other U.S. installations in the Pacific. And thereâs even a âdietyâ paragraph inserted by top Presidential assistant Harry Hopkins.</p>\n<p>In âFDRâs âDay of Infamyâ Speech: Crafting a Call to Arms,â Prologue shows you pages from all the drafts, as well as the transcribed version of his actual delivery to Congress on December 8, 1941.</p>\n<p>The six-minute speech ended with a request for a declaration of war, which Congress approved within hours.</p>\n<p>The article is posted online at <a href=\"http://www.archives.gov/publications/prologue/2001/winter/crafting-day-of-infamy-speech.html.\">http://www.archives.gov/publications/prologue/2001/winter/crafting-day-of-infamy-speech.html.</a></p>\n</blockquote>",
