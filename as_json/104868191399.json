What I mean is that it should be impossible for you to call this number, and I need to know how you got it.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>I explain that itâs randomly generated and Iâm very sorry for bothering him, and go to hang up. And before I can click terminate, I hear:</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Maâam, this is a matter of national security.&rdquo;</p>\n<p><em>I accidentally called the director of the FBI.</em></p>\n<p>My job got investigated because a computer randomly spit out a number to the Pentagon.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This is my new favourite story.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>When I was in college I got a job working for a company that manages major air-travel data. It was a temp gig working their out of date system while they moved over to a new one, since my knowing MS Dos apparently made me qualified.</p>\n<p>There was no MS Dos involved. Instead, there was a proprietary type-based OS and an actually-uses-transistors refrigerator-sized computer with switches I had to trip at certain times during the night as I watched the data flow from six pm to six AM on Fridays and weekends. If things got stuck, I reset the server.Â </p>\n<p>The company handled everything from low-end data (hotel and car reservations) to flight plans and tower information. I was weighed every time I came in to make sure it was me. Areas of the building had retina scanners on doors.Â </p>\n<p>During training. they took us through all the procedures. Including the procedures for the red phone. There was, literally, a red phone on the shelf above my desk. âThis is a holdover from the cold war.â They said. âIt isnât going to come up, but hereâs the deal. In case of nuclear war or other nation-wide disaster, the phone will ring. Pick up the phone, state your name and station, and await instructions. Do whatever you are told.â</p>\n<p>So my third night there, itâs around 2am and thereâs a ringing sound.Â </p>\n<p>I look up, slowly. The Red phone is ringing.</p>\n<p>So I reach out, I pick up the phone. I give my name and station number. And I hear every station head in the building do the exact same. One after another, voices giving names and numbers. Then silence for the space of two breaths. Silence broken byâ¦</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Uhâ¦ Is Shantavia there?&rdquo;</p>\n<p><span>It turns out that every toll free, 1-900 or priority number has a corresponding local number that it routs to at its actual destination. Some poor teenage girl was trying to dial a friend of hers, mixed up the numbers, and got the atomic attack alert line for a major air-travel corporationâs command center in the mid-west United States.</span></p>\n<p>Thereâs another pause, and the guys over in the main data room are cracking up. The overnight site head is saying âI think you have the wrong number, maâam.â and Iâm standing there having faced the specter of nuclear annihilation before I was old enough to legally drink.</p>\n<p>The red phone never rang again while I was there, so the people doing my training were only<strong> slightly</strong> wrong in their estimation of how often the doomsday phone would ring.Â </p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>IT GOT SO MUCH BETTER</p>\n</blockquote>",
