I wish you the best of luck with your Ethology exam (and all of your exams!) and just remember that there is rarely a straight answer in Ethology. So if you take your time, break it down, and reason through each question bit-by-bit (while providing plenty of support for your argument) Iâm sure youâll do great!</p>\n<p>As for the Proximate vs Ultimate perspectives; are you referring to Mayrâs build on Tinbergenâs Four Questions? (People call the questions different names âhows vs whysâ; âTinbergenâs Four Whyâsââ¦ it can get terribly confusing depending on what source youâre reading) So if youâre interested, we can do a quick break down.<br/></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://thejunglenook.tumblr.com/post/105368959995/hello-i-just-found-you-thanks-to-that-post-about\">Read More</a></p>",

   "question" : "Hello! I just found you thanks to that post about how animals play with toys and let me just say, I wish I found you sooner! I&#039;m about to take my own ethology final exam on Weds., and it would have been so helpful if I could have read all your ethology related posts before hand. (some times I still feel like I don&#039;t even have the proximate and ultimate perspectives down D:&lt; ) You have so many examples of stuff I could relate back to my classroom! Anyway, I love your blog and all that you post!",
