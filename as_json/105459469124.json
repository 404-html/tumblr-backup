   "quote-text" : "<p>The United States will restore full diplomatic relations with Cuba and open an embassy in Havana for the first time in more than a half-century after the release of an American contractor held in prison for five years, President Obama announced on Wednesday. </p>\n\n<p>In a deal negotiated during 18 months of secret talks hosted largely by Canada and encouraged by Pope Francis, who hosted a final meeting at the Vatican, Mr. Obama and President RaÃºl Castro of Cuba agreed in a telephone call to put aside decades of hostility to find a new relationship between the United States and the island nation just 90 miles off the American coast.</p>\n\n<p>âWe will end an outdated approach that for decades has failed to advance our interests and instead we will begin to normalize relations between our two countries,â Mr. Obama said in a nationally televised statement from the White House. The deal will âbegin a new chapter among the nations of the Americasâ and move beyond a ârigid policy that is rooted in events that took place before most of us were born.â</p>",
