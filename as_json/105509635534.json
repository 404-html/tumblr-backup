The man who can turn an army around at the mention of his name. &#8220;Doctor.&#8221; The word for healer and wise man throughout the Universe. We get that word from you, you know. But if you carry on the way you are, what might that word come to mean? To the people of the Gamma Forests, the word Doctor means &#8220;Mighty Warrior.&#8221; How far you&#8217;ve come. And now they&#8217;ve taken a child. The child of your best friends. And they&#8217;re going to turn her into a weapon just to bring you down. And all this, my love, in fear of you.",
