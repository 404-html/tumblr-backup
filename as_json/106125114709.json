   "quote-text" : "To start with, Batman is quite possibly the hardest super-hero in comics to buy a present for. Sure, Superman can crush coal into diamonds, but heâs also the kind of guy who would genuinely appreciate a sweater. But Batman?

I mean, this is a dude who already has a Dalek in his basement <em>just in case he needs one</em>.",
