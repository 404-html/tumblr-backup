   "quote-text" : "Tell everyone you know: âMy happiness depends on me, so youâre off the hook.â And then demonstrate it. Be happy, no matter what theyâre doing. Practice feeling good, no matter what. And before you know it, you will not give anyone else responsibility for the way you feel - and then, youâll love them all. Because the only reason you donât love them, is because youâre using them as your excuse to not feel good.",
