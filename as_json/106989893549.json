It&rsquo;s now 53 minutes into January 3, and I&rsquo;ve made it as far as <em>A Day in the Life</em> (which is right after the <em>Strawberry Field</em> takes), and it&rsquo;s a little frightening just how much this music is written into my very being and how easy it is to just singing along with this stuff. And: I&rsquo;m listening to 1967 song by a guy being nostalgic about the 1940s and &lsquo;50s while myself becoming a bit nostalgic (or more accurately, whatever the opposite of nostalgia is) about when I first heard the song in 2000. And, oh, look, look, it&rsquo;s <em>Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds</em>, one of the very first Beatles songs I ever fell in love with. Um. Yeah. Nice.</p>",
