   "quote-text" : "Well, when the issue came up of the Danish cartoons [of Muhammad] I observed that the test I apply to something to see whether it truly is satire derives from H. L. Menckenâs definition of good journalism: It should âafflict the comfortable and comfort the afflicted.â The trouble with a lot of so-called âsatireâ directed against religiously motivated extremists is that itâs not clear who itâs afflicting, or who itâs comforting. This is in no way to condone the shooting of the journalists, which is evil, pure and simple, but our society makes a fetish of âthe right to free speechâ without ever questioning what sort of responsibilities are implied by this right.",
