I like these little windows into your lives even if Iâve never seen pictures of you and all I really know is that we like a few of the same tv shows. Please continue to let me read your to do lists and your conversations with strange relatives.</p>\n<p>Thank you,</p>\n<p>Stranger from the internet.</p>\n</blockquote>",
