   "quote-text" : "First, I must confess that over the past few years I have been gravely disappointed with the white moderate. I have almost reached the regrettable conclusion that the Negroâs great stumbling block in his stride toward freedom is not the White Citizenâs Counciler or the Ku Klux Klanner, but the white moderate, who is more devoted to âorderâ than to justice; who prefers a negative peace which is the absence of tension to a positive peace which is the presence of justice; who constantly says: âI agree with you in the goal you seek, but I cannot agree with your methods of direct actionâ; who paternalistically believes he can set the timetable for another manâs freedom; who lives by a mythical concept of time and who constantly advises the Negro to wait for a âmore convenient season.â Shallow understanding from people of good will is more frustrating than absolute misunderstanding from people of ill will. Lukewarm acceptance is much more bewildering than outright rejection.",
