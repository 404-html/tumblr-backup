Take it from a Canadian. Iâve seen that bullshit in person. Scary as all heck.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>And thatâs how people can die if they hit a moose. Seriously, one of our fears when driving in the country is having to deal with this scenario of a moose jumping out in front of the car.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>moose are actual legit ice age megafauna; theyve been here since the ice age, they are old as fuck. they also are pretty terrifying and ive echoed this before but i went to wiki and â<span>In terms of raw numbers, they attack more people thanÂ </span><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bear\" title=\"Bear\">bears</a><span>Â andÂ </span><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gray_wolf\" title=\"Gray wolf\">wolves</a><span>Â combinedâ and â</span><span>Â </span><span>In the Americas, moose injure more people than any other wild mammal and, worldwide, only hippopotamuses injure more.â</span></p>\n<p><span>like, fuck off with that</span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I was dog sitting a dog once who insisted she had to go out in the middle of the night it was an emergency, so I took her out. Suddenly she starts pointing and barking and I look up and can just make out the outline of a HUGE moose. Iâve been accidentally face to face with a black bear and that scared me less than being up close with a moose. Iâm 5 foot so imagine staring up at an animal several feet taller than you that is debating charging the dog whoâs leash you are holding. I was terrified as I grabbed the dog by her collar to get better control over her and backed up slowly til I was out of line of sight and bolted for the house at a dead run. Did you know most Canadian lake monster stories come from people seeing moose swimming? They are massive animals.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>They are massive and they charge. I get so scared when tourists are all âoh yeah, we got out of the car to get a closer look and, yaâll have some mighty impressive animals around here.â<br/><br/>Yes, yes we do, and they have mighty tired guardian angels because moose can, and do, charge at people.<br/><br/>Iâve always said that moose hunting season is the one time of the year weâre allowed to fight back.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Someone my mom worked with died hitting a moose on the highway. <strong>Their eyes donât reflect light</strong>. In the dark they are literally nothing but a big slightly darker shape in the night. <br/><br/>Roughly every year in the town I grew up in, a cow (moose) and her calf will wander through downtown. Maybe once or twice. If sheâs aggressive enough, the local Mounties will escort her through to keep idiots away.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Iâve definitely talked with people who thought moose were deer-sized or maybe horse-sized and I was like NO YOU DONâT EVEN UNDERSTAND MOOSE ARE TERRIFYING</p>\n<p>Moose are terrifying, you guys.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I finally live on a province where moose and deer exist.</p>\n<p><em>I do not drive at night in fear of meeting one</em>. If you hit a moose going 90 on a highway, not only is your car trashed, you are probably trashed. IâveÂ <em>seen cars that got wrecked</em> and there seems to be a consensus that at least half the time, the giant fucking beastie just shakes itself off and continues gallumphing along the countryside.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>If you fucking hit a moose with your car and their legs go through your windshield, congratulations, you are dead. Massive hooves kicking you to death? Yeah.Â </p>\n<p>Moose are fucking terrifying. Bull moose wonât fuck with you too much unless you fuck with them, but the time a bull moose casually swaggered his way past 7 year old me when I was sledding literally put me off winter sports for a solid month.Â </p>\n<p>Momma moose and their babies, though? I legitimately had to call in to work to be like âey yo there is a moose in my driveway and I canât get outâ AND MY MANAGERS UNDERSTOOD.</p>\n<p>Moose. MOOSE.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I have to admit I thought they were like a Canadian deer before this.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>My ex went to school in Canada and she started telling this horrifying story about someone in her house who had a moose wander in front of her while driving, and everyone was like, âIâm so sorry, how long ago did she pass?â and my friend was like, âOh no, she lived. She was in a (Toyota) Celica and she went right underneath it. Just scratched the paint and took the mirrors off.â Now, think about that for a minute. A moose is SO LARGE that a low-slung coupe can DRIVE UNDER IT.<br/><br/>I have so much respect for moose. I hope to see one someday. From afar.</p>\n</blockquote>",
