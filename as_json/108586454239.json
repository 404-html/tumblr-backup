   "quote-text" : "The third exemplary teacher was Richard Eakin, the embryologist, who gave the most technically perfect lectures I&#8217;ve ever seen. They started right on the hour, had a beginning, a middle, and an end, perfect pacing, crystal clear explanations, beautiful drawings, and ended EXACTLY at 50 after the hour. I later found out that he memorized every lecture, like the script for a play, so he would always have the exactly correct word and phrasing. He could also edit in his head, so if a student asked a question that took 47 seconds to answer, he&#8217;d STILL end exactly on time, and not leave out anything important.",
