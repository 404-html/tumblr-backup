This is my <strike>life scarring sight</strike> holidays gift for you: Same character, 8 years apart.</p>\n<p>Your favourite artist is hardly âtalentedâ; at some point of their lives what was their very best simply wasnât enough. Their very best today will look equally cringeful to them in a couple of years. It didnât came easy to him or her. This artist probably didnât have better opportunities than you. What they had was an earlier start and an unwavering determination.</p>\n<p>Get up and work hard today. Itâs okay if you donât have your dream job yet. Even if you have to work on/study something else for now think of it as being your own patron, because thatâs what it is. Every tiny step counts, in time theyâll take you a long way, and this is the beauty of painting: Itâs not something dependable on a diploma stating that youâre able to do something, nor itâs an innate ability, itâs an achievable skill that depends only on your efforts. Believe! Youâll get <em>there</em>.</p>\n<h3 class=\"pt\">| PORTUGUÃS |</h3>\n</div>\n<p><a href=\"http://vielmond.tumblr.com/post/106508597605/talent-is-a-lie\">Read More</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n</blockquote>",
