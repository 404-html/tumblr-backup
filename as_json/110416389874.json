Park wildlife biologists had gone on a five-day backcountry trip to the far northern part of the park to check on previously deployed motion-sensitive cameras. They documented a sighting of the fox on two separate instances (December 13, 2014 and January 4, 2015) within the park boundary. The Sierra Nevada red fox of California is one of the rarest mammals in North America, likely consisting of fewer than 50 individuals. âWe are thrilled to hear about the sighting of the Sierra Nevada red fox, one of the most rare and elusive animals in the Sierra Nevada,â stated Don Neubacher, Yosemite National Park Superintendent. âNational parks like Yosemite provide habitat for all wildlife and it is encouraging to see that the red fox was sighted in the park.â</p>\n</blockquote>",
