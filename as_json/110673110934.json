   "quote-text" : "If your friend is crying over a break up in the middle of the night, and you have a Psychology final at 6 AM.. itâs okay to choose the test and support her in the morning. If youâve promised someone that you would see a movie with them but stayed up all night coughing your brains out.. itâs okay to reschedule. You do not need to feel obligated to sacrifice your own self for the sake of someone else all of the time. The only person I was born to nurture is me.",
