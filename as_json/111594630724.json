   "answer" : "<blockquote>\n<p><span>(cont.)â¦ better off justâ¦ doing something else? Or not doing anything?</span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>As someone who has fought through her own horrid cocktail of mental illness and disability issues, and who hasnât always been able to get appropriate treatment for said issues; I can tell you that you most certainly can be an excellent Ethologist, scientist, and adult.Â </p>\n<p>Will it be easy?Â <span>No.Â </span><br/>But I severely doubt that anything will seem <em>easy</em> when battling an illness like depression. That doesnât mean that you canât or wonât succeed in Ethology. Heck, my research often helps me in my management because I know that I have a measure of control in my work that I cannot achieve anywhere else in my life. Thatâs just me though.</p>\n<p>Do not let this illness, or mental health stigma, limit you. There are <a href=\"http://gsappweb.rutgers.edu/centers/stigma/people.php\">prominent writers, actors, musicians</a>, and <a href=\"http://mentalfloss.com/article/12500/11-historical-geniuses-and-their-possible-mental-disorders\" title=\"Charles Darwin was incapacitated by his illness(es) but that doesn't make it contributions the field any less crucial\">scientists</a> with various mental health issues. I do not know your situation but please please talk to disability services or other appropriate personnel at your university. They may know of <a href=\"https://www.jedfoundation.org/\">student-only resources</a> like <a href=\"http://thinkprogress.org/health/2014/10/06/3576462/college-mental-health-services/\" title=\"Colleges are improving mental health services for their students\">affordable therapy or insurance </a>that could help you get appropriate treatment (or at least assistance) for your situation.Â </p>\n<p>Welcome to Team Ethology, my friend. Weâre happy to have you here on the Science Side.</p>\n<p>xoxo,<br/>Your friendly neighborhood Ethologist</p>\n<p><img alt=\"image\" src=\"http://67.media.tumblr.com/c98a5541d29f4d463fc3421f6fb93c7b/tumblr_inline_ni3lm6qrmI1rdedp7.gif\"/></p>\n\n<p><span>Edit (because I love it when the Science Side looks out for each other)</span></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://gulabis.tumblr.com/\">gulabis</a><span>Â replied:Â <br/></span><span>yo yo person who sent this ask i hope youâre reading this and you know you arenât alone! i donât have access to meds either and i have pretty severe depression and while iâm not an ethologist, iâm still a scientist. i believe in you!</span></p>",
