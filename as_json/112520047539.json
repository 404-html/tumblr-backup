They all had arrows on their heads. I didnât know who any of them were, or what any of it meant. I was just exploring it all on paper. I did know that I liked this mystery kidâs spirit and I wanted to know more about him. </p><p>This thing is just under thirteen years old! You never know how a single drawing will change the course of your life, and the lives of many other people. I guess the lesson here is to just keep drawing, and follow the characters on the page wherever they may take you.</p></blockquote>",
