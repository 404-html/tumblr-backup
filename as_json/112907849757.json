   "quote-text" : "Giulia and I fell in love effortlessly, in our carefree teens. Weâve now loved each other desperately, through psychosis. At our wedding we promised this to each other: to love each other and stick together in good times and in bad. In hindsight, we also should have promised to love each other when life is normal. Itâs those normal days, now transformed by crisis, that have strained our marriage most.",
