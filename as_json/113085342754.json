It gained a bit when he said âI bet you didnât play it through, I bet somebody just told you howâ¦â and I was able to smile gently and say âGod, possibly, since <em>I wrote the game.â</em> And plainly the Deity was with me that day, as I happened to be carrying docs from my UK agent (whoâd done the deal) that showed not only that I was the writer, but the five-figure sum I had been paid. â¦It was a happy day for me. Not so much for him. Iâd never had a referent for the word âslinkâ for a full grown male before. As in âslink away in utter dejection.â I smiled for at least three days without stopping. And am smiling nowâ¦ I had completely forgotten about this.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Reblogging because âI beat the gameâ is fantastic, but âI wrote the damn thingâ isÂ <em>even better.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Iâm not a gamer but Iâll always reblog these.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Vicious. I love it.</p>\n</blockquote>",
