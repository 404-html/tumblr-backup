While initially resisting, Caesar tripped and fell, the assassins gathering around and stabbed him 23 times. Though their aim was to remove a tyrant and restore republicanism, they hadnât foreseen the consequences of their actions. The Roman people, who loved Caesar, were outraged. Caesarâs lieutenant and close friend Mark Anthony took advantage of the situation to seize control of Rome, but discovered that Caesar had made his adopted son Octavian his sole heir. Mark Anthony and Octavian put aside their quarrels to bring the assassins to justice, starting a civil war. After Brutus and Cassius had been defeated and killed, Mark Anthony and Octavian, now Caesar, divided the Republic between them. It wasnât long before Mark Anthony and Octavian clashed in another civil war, with Anthony ultimately being defeated. From this Octavian emerged as Caesar Augustus, the first Roman Emperor. The final failure of Caesarâs assassins was complete.</p>\n<p>Picture- The Death of Caesar, Jean-LÃ©on GÃ©rÃ´me, 1859-1867</p></blockquote>",
