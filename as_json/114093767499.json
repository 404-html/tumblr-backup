B. Leschen in The Coleopteristâs Bulletin</a> to provide a new generic home for a previously described species, <i>Parkerola gigantea</i> (Broun), pictured above. Check out the etymology section for the new genus:</p><blockquote><div><b>Etymology</b>. This new genus is dedicated to the authorsâ friends, Heidi and Joseph Parker, on theoccasion of their marriage and honoring Joeâs workon pselaphine inquilines. In early 2015, Joe and Heidi\nbecame parents of Jonah Wallace Parker (7 lbs. 10 oz.).<br/></div></blockquote><p>Heidi &amp; Joe are great people and friends of mine (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/HeidiKayDeidi\">Heidi</a> is a brilliant evolutionary biologist and one of my co-hosts on Breaking Bio, while <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Pselaphinae\">Joe</a> is an evo-devo biologist/beetle taxonomist), and that they were recognized with such a touching patronym warms my heart.</p><p>Taxonomists are sometimes portrayed as pedantic curmudgeons who donât interact well with other researchers or the public, but in reality they are some of the most passionate, loving, and supporting people Iâve ever had the pleasure of knowing. On this #TaxonomyDay, I think this is a perfect example of how close-knit the taxonomic community truly is.</p><p>So thank you ShÃ»hei &amp; Richard for helping society better understand pselaphine rove beetles, and for infusing your work with a touching piece of personality.</p></blockquote>",
