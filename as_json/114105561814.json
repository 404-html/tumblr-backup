   "quote-text" : "<p>I donât think C gets enough credit. Sure, C doesnât love you. C isnât about loveâC is about thrills. C hangs around in the bad part of town. C knows all the gang signs. C has a motorcycle, and wears the leathers everywhere, and never wears a helmet, because that would mess up Câs punked-out hair. C likes to give cops the finger and grin and speed away. Mention that youâd like something, and C will pretend to ignore you; the next day, C will bring you one, no questions asked, and toss it to you with a you-know-you-want-me smirk that makes your heart race. Where did C get it? âIt fell off a truck,â C says, putting away the boltcutters. You start to feel like C doesnât know the meaning of âprivateâ or âprotectedâ: what C wants, C takes. This excites you. C knows how to get you anything but safety. C will give you anything but commitment.</p>\n\n<p>In the end, youâll leave C, not because you want something better, but because you canât handle the intensity. C says âIâm gonna live fast, die young, and leave a good-looking corpse,â but you know that C can never die, not so long as C is still the fastest thing on the road.</p>",
