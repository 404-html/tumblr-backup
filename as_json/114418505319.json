Â She too has pushed you back because she is above all infused with a substance I have seen only once before. In her mother.</p>\n\n<p>So of course, you have now come for her too.</p>\n\n<p>You cannot have her.</p>\n\n<p>You may beg to differ, countering with the daunting facts of a glioblastoma, one of your more insidious and awful manifestations. Â But you would be wrong. Â Because here is what you cannot take.</p>\n\n<p>You cannot take that only hours after your diagnosis she came home and danced to the Rebirth Brass Band with her daughter, a brain tumor ballet of sorts, laughing right in your face.</p>\n\n<p>You cannot take that the next morning, she went right back to discussing the joys of scientific discovery, before then cracking up the worldâs most accomplished neurosurgeon with jokes about Bayesian statistics and an unsuppressed excitement that she gets to be awake when he removes all of you that he can.</p>\n\n<p>You cannot take that what hurts her most in all of this is what it means not for her, but for everyone else.</p>",
