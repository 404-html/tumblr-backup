I shoved some sweet potato into cardboard toilet paper tubes, packed in with shredded paper towels. At first they were just excited about the paper towel shreds and started making a nest, then they found the sweet potato and lost their minds. Like they couldnât believe what a good and gracious world they lived in that there could be sweet potato and paper towel at the same time. </p></blockquote>",
