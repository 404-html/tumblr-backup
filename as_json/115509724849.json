The tree shears away from itself<br/>\nand falls on a car, killing a high school girl.<br/>\nOr maybe it just crashes down<br/>\non a few trash cans, and the next day<br/>\ngets cut up and hauled away by the city.<br/>\nEither way, hilarity. The gods are infinitely perfect<br/>\nas is their divine mac and cheese.",
