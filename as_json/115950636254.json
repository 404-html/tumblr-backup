A wholesale grocer and a retired major in the Virginia Militia, he was too old to return to active duty in 1861, but on June 21 the Union Army attacked the Confederate forces near McLeanâs Yorkshire Plantation in Manassas, Prince William County,Virginia. Fighting spilled over his property and a cannonball fired by Union artillery dropped into his fireplace. When the battle was over, McLean decided to move because his commercial activities of supplying sugar to the Confederacy were centered mainly in Southern Virginia, and the presence of the Union Army in Northern Virginia made his work next to impossible. He was also determined to remove his family from such a dangerous area where a combat experience could easily reoccur, endangering them and his property.<br/><br/>In the spring of 1863, McLean and his family moved 120 miles south to Appomattox County, Virginia near a small crossroads community called Appomattox Court House. But on April 9<sup>th</sup>, 1865, the war came again to knock on his front door when a messenger from General Robert E. Lee requested the use of McLeanâs home to meet with General Ulysses S. Grant. McLean reluctantly agreed. There the two Generals and their aides met, and Lee surrendered his army to Grant in the parlor of McLeanâs house, effectively ending the American Civil War. The generous terms allowed the Confederate officers to keep their side arms, and the soldiers to keep their horses, which they would need for the spring plowing. When Lee left to announce the surrender to his troops, officers of the Union Army entered McLeanâs house and began to take souvenirs, tables, chairs, and various other furnishings that they could get, handing the protesting McLean money as they made off with his property. Later, a disgusted McLean is supposed to have said âThe war began in my front yard and ended in my front parlor.â<br/><br/>McLeanâs house is now part of <a href=\"http://www.nps.gov/apco/index.htm\">Appomattox Court House National Historical Monument</a> operated by the U.S. Department of the Interior.</blockquote><p><b>Keep Reading atÂ <a href=\"http://blogs.archives.gov/unwritten-record/2015/04/06/the-civil-war-ends-at-appomattox-court-house/\">The Unwritten Record Â» <i>The Civil War Ends at Appomattox Court House</i></a>Â Â»</b></p></blockquote>"
