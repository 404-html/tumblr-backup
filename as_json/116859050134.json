He had reached out \nfor advice from a couple of animatorsâPixarâs Aaron Hartline and \nDreamWorksâs Jim van dereylâand received letters of encouragement from \nboth of them. Aaronâs letter is at the top of this post.</p><p>âI posted the letter I received from Aaron Hartline online on my blog, and within a few weeks, the popular website <a href=\"http://www.lettersofnote.com/2010/09/dont-give-up.html\">Letters of Note</a>\n found it and published it on their website,â Downs told Cartoon Brew \nvia email. âNearly overnight, Aaronâs letter became viral and people \naround the world were reading it and sending me emails saying how they \nwere encouraged by it. Aaron said he was being stopped in the halls of \nPixar by fellow animators saying they had read his encouraging letter. I\n started thinking about what had happened, and thought that if one \nletter written to me could inspire so many people, then what would \nhappen if I could get other professional animators to write encouraging \nletters to aspiring animators, encouraging them to not give up on their \ndreams.â</p><p>The Animator Letters Project has received more than fifty letters to \ndate, ranging from animators with just a year of industry experience to \nthose with more than forty yearsâ experience. Most of them are \nhandwrittenâa feature inspired by Downsâ own experience receiving \nhandwritten letters from family members while serving in the military. </p><p>âHandwritten letters always had that personal touch that helped me \nâfeelâ their voice in the letter,â Downs said. âWe are all so used to \nseeing texts, emails, and blogs that we have nearly forgotten about the \npersonal feel of a handwritten letter.â</p><p>Downs will be accepting letters from artists until May 17, after \nwhich he intends to pitch the project to book publishers. Anyone looking\n to get in touch can contact him via <a href=\"http://theanimatorlettersproject.com/contact/\">his website</a>.</p><p>âEvery story truly is unique and different,â says Downs. âEveryone \nhas gone through something, been challenged by something, that someone \nelse out there can learn from or be encouraged by.â</p><p><i>This story was originally published on <a href=\"http://www.cartoonbrew.com\">CartoonBrew.com</a>.</i><br/></p></blockquote>",
