   "quote-text" : "Matthew Weiner: Joan knows that a shark is going to eat her on her 200th birthday, and it doesnât bother her at all. Every evening, she gets a phone call from a wizard in the middle of the night, and the wizard says, âA shark will swallow you when you are ancient,â and Joan always says, âSo fucking what? I canât wait.â The reason why Joan is destined to live until she is 200 years old is because her father accidentally ran over the wizard in his car, so the wizard put a curse on his daughter. This backstory informs every aspect of Joanâs character, even though itâs only hinted at a few times over the course of the show.",
