   "quote-text" : "Sometimes a friend with depression will say no to a lot of things and decline all or most of your invitations. This can make you feel like youâre overstepping boundaries and should immediately leave them alone until they reach out to you themselves. Pay attention to this feeling: itâs true that when people keep saying no to things you ask, itâs probably a good idea to stop asking. However, depression can also cause people to say no while wishing they could say yes.<br/>\nThe way to deal with this is not to assume, but to just ask directly: âYouâve said no the past few times Iâve invited you to do something. Thatâs okay, but I just wanted to check: would you like me to keep inviting you?â Iâve done this before with other people dealing with depression and found that they often respond that they do want me to keep asking, and they hope that one of these days theyâll be able to say yes.",
