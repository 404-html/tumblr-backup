Youâd think assembling a team of Jugheads (Jugshead?) would lead to them doing something that only four Jugheads could do, like eating an impossibly huge burger. Instead, Jughead Prime just uses his past selves as cannon fodder to attract Morganâs fire, which has got to be the worst plan anyone has ever come up with. He literally had infinite time to come up with this, and did not think it through at all.",
