   "quote-text" : "2) I will now explain why your error is even more shit than it looks. You see, i was making a joke. I do that sometimes. I have set up the street as &ldquo;sexually-charged&rdquo;. I have described the shenanigans across the road at G.A.Y.. I have used the word &lsquo;gaily&rsquo; as a gentle nudge. And &ldquo;looking for a nosh&rdquo; has a secondary meaning of looking for a blowjob. Not specifically gay, for this is soho, and there are plenty of girls there who take money for noshing boys. &ldquo;looking for nosh&rdquo; does not have that ambiguity. the joke is gone. I only wrote that sodding paragraph to make that joke. And you&rsquo;ve fucking stripped it out like a pissed Irish plasterer restoring a renaissance fresco and thinking jesus looks shit with a bear so plastering over it. You might as well have removed the whole paragraph. I mean, fucking christ, don&rsquo;t you read the copy?"
