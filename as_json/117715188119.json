The assault was committed with such violence that the youthâs testicles were literally ruptured.</b></p>\n<p>Now, Darrin Manning of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania may never be able to father children, according to the doctors who performed surgery on his virtually destroyed testicles.</p>\n<p>Darrin was a star basketball player with no criminal history to speak of. He was a straight-A student who never got into any sort of trouble. He was with his teammates heading to a game right after school when he encountered an officer who decided he was âsuspiciousâ and needed to be subjected to local âstop and friskâ procedures.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Though no official reason has been given for the stop and frisk, Darrin and the other (uniformed) members of the basketball team who were stopped suggest it was because they were wearing scarves over their faces to protect against the extreme cold Philadelphia, like much of the country, has suffered this winter.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Darrin was put in handcuffs. When the officer began âfriskingâ him, they grabbed hold of Darrinâs genitals so hard, pulled and twisted, that the teenâs genitals literally tore off.</p>\n<p>âI felt the officer reach and grab my butt. Then the officer grabbed my testicles and squeezed again and pulled down. And thatâs when I heard something pop, like I felt it POP,â Manning said.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The incident <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tiDIUwQRmQ\">has left</a> the 16-year-old with felony charges of assault and resisting arrest.</p>\n<p><b>âIâm just grateful that they just didnât kill him,â <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tiDIUwQRmQ\">said Darrinâs mother</a>.</b></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>the police are out of fucking control</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>HE GOT THE CHARGES! IâM FUCKING DONE!</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Iâm so sorry America still exists</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>FUCK THE POLICE, DEADASS</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I donât even know what the fuck to say.</p></blockquote>\n\n<p>Why man</p></blockquote>\n\n<p>âIâm just grateful that they just didnât kill himâ. like thats what this has gotten to. </p></blockquote>\n\n<p>this is unbelievable</p></blockquote>\n\n<p>But people are shocked when riots break out?</p></blockquote>"
