Basically, the Sultan was like, âI command you to surrender to my army,â and then the Cossacks were all:Â </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>O sultan, Turkish devil and damned devilâs kith and kin, secretary to Lucifer himself. <strong>What the devil kind of knight are you, that canât slay a hedgehog with his naked ass?</strong> <strong>The devil excretes, and your army eats</strong>. You will not, you son of a bitch, make subjects of Christian sons; weâve no fear of your army, by land and by sea we will battle with thee, <strong>fuck your mother</strong>.<br/><br/><strong>You Babylonian scullion, Macedonian wheelwright, brewer of Jerusalem, goat-fucker of Alexandria, swineherd of Greater and Lesser Egypt, Armenian pig, Podolian thief, catamite of Tartary</strong>, hangman of Kamyanets, and fool of all the world and underworld, an idiot before God, grandson of the Serpent, and <strong>the crick in our dick</strong>. Pigâs snout, mareâs ass, slaughterhouse cur, unchristened brow, screw your own mother!<br/><br/> So the Zaporozhians declare, you lowlife. You wonât even be herding Christian pigs. Now weâll conclude, for we donât know the date and donât own a calendar; the moonâs in the sky, the year with the Lord, the dayâs the same over here as it is over there; for this kiss our ass!</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>What a marvelous display of aggressive douchery. Itâs actually even better if you read the Sultanâs letter first, because the entire set-up of <em>this</em> letter is to parody the Sultanâs diplomatic language in the original. Wikipedia has <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reply_of_the_Zaporozhian_Cossacks\">some more basic info</a> on the 19th century recovery of the letter BTW, plus the painting that was inspired by the exchange.</p>\n<p>Thanks, History.</p>\n</blockquote>",
