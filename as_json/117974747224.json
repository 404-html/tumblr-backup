   "quote-text" : "<p>When you are 13 years old, <br/>\nthe heat will be turned up too high<br/>\nand the stars will not be in your favor. <br/>\nYou will hide behind a bookcase<br/>\nwith your family and everything left behind. <br/>\nYou will pour an ocean into a diary. <br/>\nWhen they find you, you will be nothing<br/>\nbut a spark above a burning bush, <br/>\nstill, tell themDespite everything, I really believe people are good at heart.</p>\n\n<p><br/>\nWhen you are 14, <br/>\na voice will call you to greatness. <br/>\nWhen the doubters call you crazy, do not listen.<br/>\nThey donât know the sound <br/>\nof their own Godâs whisper. Use your armor, <br/>\nuse your sword, use your two good hands. <br/>\nDo not let their doubting <br/>\ndrown out the sound of your own heartbeat.<br/>\nYou are the Maid of Untamed Patriotism.<br/>\nBorn to lead armies into victory and unite a nation<br/>\nlike a broken heart.</p>\n\n<p><br/>\nWhen you are 15, you will be punished <br/>\nfor learning too proudly. A man <br/>\nwill climb onto your school bus and insist <br/>\nyour sisters name you enemy. <br/>\nWhen you do not hide, <br/>\nhe will point his gun at your temple <br/>\nand fire three times. Three years later, <br/>\nin an ocean of words, with no apologies,<br/>\nyou will stand before the leaders of the world <br/>\nand tell them your country is burning.</p>\n\n<p><br/>\nWhen you are 16 years old, <br/>\nyou will invent science fiction. <br/>\nThe story of a man named Frankenstein <br/>\nand his creation. Soon after you will learn <br/>\nthat little girls with big ideas are more terrifying <br/>\nthan monsters, but donât worry. <br/>\nYou will be remembered long after <br/>\nthey have put down their torches.</p>\n\n<p>When you are 17 years old, <br/>\nyou will strike out Babe Ruth and Lou Gehrig<br/>\none right after the other. <br/>\nMen will be afraid of the lightening <br/>\nin your fingertips. A few days later <br/>\nyou will be fired from the major leagues <br/>\nbecause âGirls are too delicate to play baseballâ</p>\n\n<p>You will turn 18 with a baby on your back <br/>\nleading Lewis and Clark <br/>\nacross North America.</p>\n\n<p>You will turn 18Â <br/>\nand become queen of the Nile.</p>\n\n<p>You will turn 18Â <br/>\nand bring justice to journalism.</p>\n\n<p>You are now 18, standing on the precipice,<br/>\ntrembling before your own greatness. </p>\n\n<p>This is your call to leap.</p>\n\n<p>There will always being those <br/>\nwho say you are too young and delicate <br/>\nto make anything happen for yourself. <br/>\nThey donât see the part of you that smolders.<br/>\nDonât let their doubting drown out the sound <br/>\nof your own heartbeat.</p>\n\n<p>You are the first drop of a hurricane.<br/>\nYour bravery builds beyond you. You are needed<br/>\nby all the little girls still living in secret, <br/>\nwriting oceans made of monsters and<br/>\nthrowing like lightening.</p>\n\n<p>You donât need to grow up to find greatness.<br/>\nYou are stronger than the world has ever believed you to be.<br/>\nThe world laid out before you to set on fire.<br/>\nAll you have to do<br/>\nis burn.</p>",
