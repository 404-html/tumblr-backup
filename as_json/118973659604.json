You taught me that.\nHank Moody: I guess I don't like the consequences of my actions very much right now.\nBecca:  Yeah. Me neither.\n[pause]\nHank: So, uh ... what is it that you like so much about this boy?\nBecca: I don't know.\nHank: Come on. It's got to be something. Use your words.\nBecca: He's really smart.\nHank: Oh. Let's not go crazy.\nBecca: [slight embarrassment] And he makes me feel pretty.\nHank: Well, that you are. You're very pretty. You're beautiful.\nBecca: Shut up. I'm not beautiful.\nHank: Don't say that. Look. Don't ever say that, you are BEAUTIFUL, you are the most beautiful thing in the world to me.\nBecca: [annoyed] Then treat me that way. [voice breaking] I'm ALWAYS on your side, dad, always. Even when I shouldn't be. But I'm sick of it. Get your shit together before it's too late. I don't CARE if you and mom never say another kind word to each other, but I'm sick and tired of parenting you both. <em>I'm a fucking kid</em>, I don't know what I'm doing half the time. But I do know this -- if you keep cracking jokes and taking another drink and pretending that life is one big, stupid party, you will miss everything.",
