One of the coolest scenes in the new <i>Avengers</i> movie is when Captain America is fighting Ultron on the back of a truck, and Black Widow drops her electric Harley-Davidson out of the quinjet to go back him up. Is thatâ¦ is that sentence gibberish? Okay, try this: âScarlet Johansson drives a motorcycle out of a fighter jet.â But when the toys based on that scene came out, they pretended that it was Captain America dropping out of the quinjet. To go â¦ rescue himself?</p><p>Why? Because Marvel doesnât care about marketing to women. Not because theyâre sexist (or, at least not just because of that) but because thatâs literally not their job. According to <a href=\"http://www.themarysue.com/invisible-women/\">this anonymous insider article</a>, Disney bought Marvel (and, we can assume, Lucasfilm) specifically to target boys. They already have the female market on freaking lockdown with the unstoppable juggernaut that is their Disney Princess âuniverse,â and they wanted a way to get their greasy little demon-claws on the brains of teenage boys as well.</p><p><b><a href=\"http://www.cracked.com/blog/5-reasons-dividing-toys-by-gender-ruining-world/\">5 Ways Kidsâ Toys Are Shockingly Good At Teaching Sexism</a></b></p></blockquote>",
