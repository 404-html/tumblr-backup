Itâs not even âhereâs how to get rid of vampiresâ - itâs more like âhereâs how to exploit your vampire problem for personal gainâ, or even âhereâs how to live with the fact that your neighbour is probably a vampireâ. Sure, everybody knows that old Vladislaus and his wife are blood-sucking abominationsâ¦ but, well, come harvest time, you need every pair of hands you can get. So just smile and nod, hang fresh garlic in your windows every new moon, and try not to think too hard about what theyâre using to fertilise those strangely vigorous crops.<br/></p></blockquote>",
