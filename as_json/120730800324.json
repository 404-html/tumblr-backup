Iâm really sorry. There are a lot of details to keep straight and a lot of steps of communication in the process and we try as hard as we can, but sometimes weâre moving so fast that we forget you wanted soy and totally ruin your day if youâre lactose intolerant. trust me, as many times as I have complaints about terrible customers, I donât actually want to ruin anyoneâs day. (except you, max. you are a horrible person. sometimes I want to ruin your day. I never once have messed up your drink though, either on purpose or by accident.)</p><p>so in case youâre worried about complaining about your drink, LET ME ABSOLVE YOU.</p><p>Seriously. <i>Please</i> tell me when your drink is wrong. You pay entirely too much for coffee to have a drink you donât really want or straight up messes with your digestive system. Sometimes this puts a kink in the system though, so if weâre busy and your barista is holding back a sneer, itâs probably not you. Itâs probably directed at their coworker at the register who wrote the drink wrong. But if you want to make sure itâs not directed at you, here are some helpful hints:</p><p>1. PAY ATTENTION WHEN YOU ORDER. This is absolutely the first step. Tell all the details to your register person, even if that person has known your drink for years, because that person is more likely to write all the details down. Sometimes things are moving so fast that your barista isnât looking up, so the iced mocha for Dave may not automatically registerÂ âno whipped creamâ for Regular Customer Dave, because frankly, I promise, youâre not the only iced mocha for Dave that has come through the line that day. I swear, there is a woman who nearly every day has to have her drink remade because she NEVER remembers to sayÂ âno foam, extra hotâ at the register and she comes during the heat of the rush, orders a very common drink, has a common name, and hides in the back of the room while she waits. We have like zero chance of magically making that drink no foam extra hot without the instruction.Â </p><p>2. âIâm sorry to bother you, butâ is absolutely the best way to start theÂ âhey you f*cked upâ conversation. Youâre not actually bothering me and you donât have to apologize, but my natural response to this is to tell you itâs nothing, really, and Iâm ready to listen to your issue with compassion and cheerfully remake your drink - because you took a second to empathize with the fact Iâm feeling like an octopus-barista remembering 14 things at once. Yelling THIS IS SUPPOSED TO BE SOY or snapping at me like Iâm an idiot doesnât make me cheerful. I realize you may be frustrated because itâs totally my fault or my coworkerâs fault that we messed up, but a little kindness goes a long way.</p><p>3. Really really on the nice thing. The following things can happen to nice people: 1) I try super hard to get it perfect, and will probably ask you follow-up questions about small details of your preferences to go above and beyond, 2) I will probably remember you next time and try hard to make it perfect then too, 3) you will probably get the messed up drink for free (theyâre usually perfectly good, just the wrong size or not extra hot) to have yourself or give to a friend (and I totally throw away the rejected drink for rude people), 4) my manager might give you a coupon for next time.</p><p>But really. If itâs wrong, say something. We are trained not to retaliate and that remaking the occasional drink is expected. Weâre not punished for returned drinks. Iâm really not offended - in fact, I feel terrible when regulars suck it up and drink something that isnât right just because they donât want to be the person who returns a drink. I really do want to make your drink right. Itâs just way better to remake drinks for nice people.</p></blockquote>",
