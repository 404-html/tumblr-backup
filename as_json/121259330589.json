   "quote-text" : "Spielberg, in short, used CGI when he had to, in order to get a shot or image he otherwise couldnât. In Jurassic Park, perhaps the most influential of all CGI movies, CGI is a supplementâan amazing, cutting-edge supplement, but a supplement all the same. Unfortunately, that was a lesson largely lost on the filmmakers who walked in the directorâs footsteps. What was, in Spielbergâs hands, a tool for realizing the impossible quickly became a way to achieve the merely arduous.",
