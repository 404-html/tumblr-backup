Six feet tall and beautiful.\nHank: You already are beautiful.\nBecca: Chelsea is the only friend I've ever had. The only one who accepts me for who I really am.\nHank: That is not true.\nBecca: It is. Do you know what it's like to have no one and nothing? How totally awful that feels?\nHank: Yes, I think I do, once upon a time, I felt like that. Now I have you.\nBecca: Yet, somehow, I still have nothing.",
