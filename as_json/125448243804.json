I call out a drink, and hand it over with a straw. a woman comes up, Â nodding with eye contact and reaching for the drink, and then stops. I assume that she is a bar customer answering the call for her drink, like you would. she has a fork sheâs trying to hand to me, but both my hands are full.</p><p>customer, irritated and superior tone:Â âcan I get a <i>knife</i>?â</p><p>me:Â âsure.â Iâm confused as to why sheâs handing me a fork. Iâm confused why she wonât take the straw for her drink. Turns out itâs not her drink. I put drink and straw down, take the fork and just toss it, because ew, and now I have to wash my hands since god knows where that fork has been.Â why is she giving me a fork? I leave my post to answer her query (immediately earning the ire of people waiting for bar drinks) and then find out we are out of knives.</p><p>me:Â âIâm sorry, weâre out of knives. Can I offer you another fork?â Oh. Thatâs why she had a fork. Why do people think I will immediately understand weird things like being handed a fork, with no explanation or prior context? Itâs not actually that easy for the human brain to switch from remembering the details of 3-4 drinks youâre making simultaneously to trying to figure out something out of the ordinary at any given split second, you know.</p><p>customer, with death glare and tone that suggests she thinks Iâm an idiot:Â âI guess now I have to spread cream cheese with a fork.â</p><p>me, finally making direct eye contact:Â âthat is a correct observation.â</p><figure data-orig-width=\"245\" data-orig-height=\"245\"><img src=\"http://33.media.tumblr.com/aca26884a145ff9f4fc1c0cc41bd0088/tumblr_inline_nsbamoXSG41rqmlcn_500.gif\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"245\" data-orig-height=\"245\"/></figure><p>Iâm pretty sure I earned myself another complaint directed at corporate.</p><p>regular customer watching this #1, quietly:Â âI was just thinking the same thing.â</p><p>regular customer watching this #2, also quietly:Â âIâm so glad you said that.â</p></blockquote>",
