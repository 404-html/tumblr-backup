Blackberries<br/>\nBig as the ball of my thumb, and dumb as eyes<br/>\nEbon in the hedges, fat<br/>\nWith blue-red juices. These they squander on my fingers.<br/>\nI had not asked for such a blood sisterhood; they must love me.<br/>\nThey accommodate themselves to my milkbottle, flattening their sides.",
