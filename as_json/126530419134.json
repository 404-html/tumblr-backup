This is the same nest as in yesterdayâs post, which showed three hatchlings. The third had already fledged when this photo was taken, and was hanging out in the brush just a few feet away. These two made the giant leap the next day.<br/><br/>Robin fledglings are still easy to observe in the park right now. You can find them on the lawns of Pier 1 being fed by their parents.</p></blockquote>",
