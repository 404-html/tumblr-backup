Â If you wear glasses, you literally need constant use of a medical aid to experience the world like most people do. Â If it were anything besides glasses, that would be considered a disability. Â But needing glasses is an extremely common, visible, and accepted form of disability to the point that we donât even consider it one, we just accept that some people need glasses and thatâs perfectly normal and thereâs nothing wrong with needing to rely on them.</p><p>That is how <i>all</i>Â disabilities and illnesses should be seen, and how we should look at treatment for them. Â You have a problem, and you need help dealing with it, and thereâs nothing wrong with either of those things. Â Thatâs perfectly normal and thatâs okay.</p><p>(via <a href=\"http://ninjarobotclone.tumblr.com/\" class=\"tumblr_blog\">ninjarobotclone</a>)</p><p>Reblogging myself bc ^^that^^ was such a beautiful addition.

   "quote-text" : "<p>I wear glasses. Â Can I manage without glasses? Â Well, yes, probably. Â I could squint a lot, constantly move up close to anything I want to see, take the bus or a taxi if I want to go anywhere. Â I could just accept that Iâll never be able to see eagles flying in the sky or whales jumping out of the ocean. Â </p>\n\n<p>But why? Â Why try so hard to manage life when I could just put on a pair of glasses? Â No one would ever suggest a near-sighted person should just work harder. Â No one would say âMaybe thatâs just your normalâ to someone that needs glasses. Â They would say âLetâs go to the eye doctor and get you a prescription so youâre able to see again.â</p>\n\n<p>You shouldnât have to try so hard.</p>",
