Living far below the surface of the oceans, giant squids had rarely been seen alive.The Museum has its own giant squid, one of the few specimens housed in a museum in North America, says Curator <a href=\"http://www.amnh.org/our-research/staff-directory/neil-landman\">Neil H. Landman</a>, who studies fossil (and living) invertebrates in the <a href=\"http://www.amnh.org/our-research/paleontology\">Division of Paleontology</a>.Â </p><p>Like all squids, giant squids each have eight arms and two longer tentacles for grasping prey. As invertebrates, they have no structural bones. Instead, a paddle-shaped internal support, called a gladius, helps them retain their form. The gladius is formed of chitin, a material also found in, for instance, insect exoskeletons. (A squidâs horny beak, also formed of chitin, is found at the base of its prey-grabbing arms; the beak allows the animal to slice and dice fish to eat.)</p><figure data-orig-width=\"1115\" data-orig-height=\"672\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"http://41.media.tumblr.com/6f2527000cca430e96751aba676f2bb6/tumblr_inline_nq95ftY8PQ1qh595v_540.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"1115\" data-orig-height=\"672\"/></figure><p>The Museumâs specimen is a sexually mature male that measures 25 feet long, with eyes that are 6 inches across. (Like many other squid species, male giant squids are probably smaller than females.) The giant squidâs arms and tentacles are dotted with rows of sharp-toothed suckers, with which the animal can grab its prey.</p><p>Learn all about how the Museumâs <a href=\"http://www.amnh.org/shelf-life/shelf-life-08-the-voyage-of-the-giant-squid?utm_source=social-media&amp;utm_medium=tumblr&amp;utm_term=20150621-sun&amp;utm_campaign=shelf\">giant squid traveled around the world</a> to become part of the Museumâs collection.Â </p><figure class=\"tmblr-embed tmblr-full\" data-provider=\"youtube\" data-orig-width=\"540\" data-orig-height=\"304\" data-url=\"https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DW47by1jPTPw\"><iframe width=\"540\" height=\"304\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/W47by1jPTPw?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></figure></blockquote>",
