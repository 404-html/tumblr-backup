   "quote-text" : "<p>It wasn&rsquo;t <em>easier</em>, the ghost explains, you just <em>knew how to do it</em>. Sometimes the easiest method you know is the hardest method there is. </p>\n\n<p>It&rsquo;s likeâ¦ to someone who only knows how to dig with a spoon, the notion of digging something as large as a <em>trench</em> will terrify them. All they know are spoons, so as far as they&rsquo;re concerned, digging is simply <em>difficult</em>. The only way they can imagine it getting any easier is if <em>they</em> change &ndash; digging with a spoon until they get stronger, faster, and tougher. And the <em>dangerous</em> people, they&rsquo;ll actually try this. </p>\n\n<p>Everyone who will ever oppose you in life is a crazy, burly dude with a spoon, and you will never be able to outspoon them. Even the powerful people, theyâre just spooning harder and more vigorously than everyone else, like hungry orphan children eating soup. Except the soup is power. Iâll level with you here: I have completely lost track of this analogy. </p>\n\n<p>What I&rsquo;m saying, giant talking cat, is that everyone is stupid. They attain a narrow grasp of reality and live their life as though there is nothing else. But you, me, <em>creatures with imagination</em> &ndash; we aren&rsquo;t constrained by our experiences. We&rsquo;re <em>inspired</em> by them. If we have trouble digging with a spoon, we build a shovel. If weâre stopped by a wall, we make a door. And if we canât make a door, we ask ourselves whether we really <em>need</em> an opening to pass through something solid in the first place. </p>\n\n<p>You point out that you&rsquo;re not a ghost, and that you do need an opening to pass through solid objects. </p>\n\n<p>No &ndash; <em>that&rsquo;s</em> your mistake, he replies. <em>That&rsquo;s</em> why you&rsquo;re still not thinking like a witchhunter. Youâre trying to do things <em>right</em>, and that&rsquo;s <em>wrong</em>. Mysticism means taking a step back &ndash; accepting that the very laws of reason and logic you abide by are merely <em>one option</em> of many. It means knowing you only see half the picture in a world where everyone else thinks they see the whole thing. It means having the sheer <em>arrogance</em> to have humility. </p>\n\n<p>That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m saying you have to <em>think like a witchhunter</em>. You have to be a little wrong to be completely right &ndash; to abandon truth in favor of questioning falsehood. If you think something&rsquo;s the easiest way, you have to <em>know you&rsquo;re wrong</em>. You have to understand how to stand against the very stance of understanding! You have to <em>know</em> you are inferior; that your knowledge and perceptions will never stand up to the true scope of all possible reality. You have to be a little further from perfect, and embrace that notion. </p>\n\n<p>Can you do that, Jo-Khajiit? Can you make mistakes, fearlessly pursue the worst ideas, and <em>be inferior</em>? </p>\n\n<p>I&rsquo;m the best fucking fuckup in Cyrodiil.</p>",
