I think that Westley was deceiving Vizzini about his use of the iocane powder.</p>\n<p>Westley describes iocane powder to Vizzini as being âodorless, tasteless, dissolves instantly in liquid, and is among the more deadly poisons known to man.âÂ </p>\n<p>When presenting the poison to Vizzini, Westley also gives him the explicit instructions âInhale this, but do not touch.â</p>\n<p>While I believe Westley may truthfully have spent several years building up a resistance to the effects of iocane powder, I propose that rather than poisoning <i>both</i> goblets as he claimed to have done, Westley didnât pour the iocane powder into either cup of wine!</p>\n<p>Especially since the iocane was in <i>powder</i> form, I suspect that rather than being an ingested poison, it was an inhalation poison!</p>\n<p><b>Vizzini wasnât poisoned when Westley poured (or didnât pour) iocane powder into the wine goblets, but when Westley told him to waft the vial of iocane powder. Since iocane powder is odorless, Vizzini wouldnât have noticed that trace amounts of one ofÂ  the âmore deadly poisons known to manâ had been introduced into his systemâ¦trace amounts that were still enough to kill a man within minutes.</b></p>\n<p>And since iocane powder came from Australia, and itâs well documented that Australia is home to some of the most venomous species of plants and animals on earth, thereâs no reason <i>not</i> to believe that such a small quantity iocane powder could have killed a man of Vizziniâs stature.</p>\n<p>Westley had already won the battle of wits before it had begun, and was simply stalling for time until the poison took itâs effect.</p>\n<p>All quotes from the script accessed from this site: [<a href=\"http://www.princessbride.8m.com/script.htm#19\">X</a>]</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This is, in all likelihood, the most important post Iâve ever made on this blue-bordered website.<br/></p></blockquote>",
