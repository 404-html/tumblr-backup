Lacey, age eleven, knew exactly what she was going to do with her life.</p>\n<p>She was going to go to Hogwarts, get top grades, and be the youngest female Minister of Magic by age 35.</p>\n<p>It would have been a good plan, if she hadnât been in the same year as Harry Potter.</p>\n<p>* Â  * Â  * Â Â </p>\n<p>Year one started out great. She was sorted into Hufflepuff, did well in all her classes, and aced the exams.</p>\n<p>A troll smashed its way through the study room she was in on Halloween, but that wasnât going to deter her.Â </p>\n<p>* Â  * Â  * Â Â </p>\n<p>Year two was a disaster. People were getting petrified, and worseâthe teachers had to herd them from place to place, which severely cut down on her library time. She had to study in the common room, which meant instead of a nice, quiet atmosphere, she got a soundtrack of nervous Hufflepuffs.</p>\n<p>And on top of that, exams were cancelled. It was a disaster.</p>\n<p>* Â  * Â  * Â Â </p>\n<p>Third year, she started to notice a trend.</p>\n<p>First the troll, than the petrifications, and now dementor guards and escaped convicts. What did they all have in common? Potter.</p>\n<p>After Black broke in and everyone had to spend the night in the Great Hall, interrupting Jennaâs last minute studying for a test the next day, she took to giving Potter angry looks in every class.</p>\n<p>He did not notice.</p>\n<p>* Â  * Â  * Â Â </p>\n<p>They announced the Triwizard tournament at dinner the first night of fourth year, and Jenna almost started crying.</p>\n<p>Potter was going to take this one over. She just knew it.</p>\n<p>And she was right.</p>\n<p>Voldemort rose at the end of the year. She honestly didnât know what she had expected.</p>\n<p>* Â  * Â  * Â Â Â </p>\n<p>Fifth year brought Umbridge. She joined the DA because she was going to need a better background in defense, but that didnât mean she was any happier about Potter.</p>\n<p>She imagined it was him she was hexing instead of Zachariah Smith.</p>\n<p>But, by the end of the year, focus on her studies was impossible. After Dumbledore left, it was complete anarchy.</p>\n<p>Potterâs fault. Of course.</p>\n<p>* Â  * Â  * Â Â </p>\n<p>Sixth year she started volunteering in the hospital wing. She needed a backup plan in case Potter fucked it up.</p>\n<p>All seemed quiet, until they brought Malfoy in. It was apparently Potterâs fault, which surprised everyone except Jenna.</p>\n<p>Later, she was peacefully studying in a little nook on the third floor when some Death Eaters and some other adults started dueling right under her nose.</p>\n<p>This was the worst fucking school, honestly.</p>\n<p>* Â  * Â  * Â Â </p>\n<p>They were calling it âThe Final Battle.â</p>\n<p>Jenna ran through the hall, dodging in and out of the children evacuating, until she saw him.Â </p>\n<p>âPOTTER.â</p>\n<p>He turned, startled. âUmâJenna, right? Weâre sort of busyââ</p>\n<p>She grabbed the front of his shirt and hauled him up until he was eye level with her. âIf Iâm not Minister of Magic by age 35, it is going to be entirely your fault and Iâm going to hurt you.â</p>\n<p>She dropped him and stormed away, leaving him to whatever he was doing. She had to fight this goddamn war so she could go back to her fucking studying.</p>\n<p>* Â  * Â  * Â Â </p>\n<p>She became Minister of Magic at age 36.</p>\n<p>Fucking Potter.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I think I just found theÂ <i>best</i> Harry Potter fanfic</p>\n</blockquote>",
