The features that are needed to best take advantage of a given niche are pretty much the same everywhere you go; thus, over time, those species will become anatomically and behaviourally similar, even though theyâre completely unrelated.</p><p>And foxes? Foxes are what you get when an ecosystem has no native small felines, so a canine species evolves to take advantage of the ecological niche that <b>would</b> have been exploited by a small feline, if one existed.<br/></p><p>In other words, a fox is literally what you get when a dog tries to cat.<br/></p></blockquote>\n\n<p>Conversely, hyenas are the feliform attempt at constructing a dog.</p></blockquote>\n\n<p>foxes and hyenas are the best</p></blockquote>\n\n<p>Convergent evolution is basically one of the coolest things ever.</p></blockquote>",
