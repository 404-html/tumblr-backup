   "quote-text" : "A little self-defense goes along way. Willis emphasizes that itâs key to teach kids that the person on the other side of the table doesnât necessarily work for them. She notes: âCurrently we have a culture where we call the person on the other side of the table, for instance, âmy broker.â Even when we go into the car dealership we say âmy guy,â but heâs not your guy. âMy realtor may be working for you, but may be working for the seller. We Americans are very trusting. We need to figure out where to put the balance. Yes, we do need to use a bank, not the mattress but itâs important to understand itâs not âyourâ bank.â",
