Ea-nasir and his dodgy business deals.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>And we havenât even touched on the true hilarity of the situation yet. Consider two additional facts:</p>\n<ul><li>He wasnât just into copper trading. There are letters complaining about Ea-nasirâs business practices with respect to everything from kitchenwares to real estate speculation to second-hand clothing. The guy was <b>everywhere</b>.</li>\n<li>The majority of the surviving correspondences regarding Ea-nasir were recovered from one particular room in a building that is believed to have been Ea-nasirâs own house.</li>\n</ul><p>Like, these are clay tablets. Theyâre bulky, fragile, and difficult to store. They typically werenât kept long-term unless they contained financial records or other vital information (which is why we have huge reams of financial data about ancient Babylon in spite of how little we know about the actual culture: most of the surviving tablets are commercial inventories, bills of sale, etc.).<br/></p>\n<p>But this guy, this Ea-nasir, he kept <b>all</b> of his angry letters - hundreds of them - and meticulously filed and preserved them in a dedicated room in his house. What kind of guy <b>does</b> that?<br/></p>\n<p>[ <a href=\"https://books.google.ca/books?id=0maIAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA276&amp;dq=ea-nasir&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=RdKUVcbaI5C7ogSdmY2gAQ&amp;ved=0CCwQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=ea-nasir&amp;f=false\">source</a> ]<br/></p>\n</blockquote>",
