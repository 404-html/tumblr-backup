   "quote-text" : "So the Greek deal is not about pitting the voters of one country against bankers, but about pitting the voters of one country against the voters of others. No one has suggested having a referendum in other countries about bailing out the Greeks, for the very good reason that they know what the answer will be. The same would have applied to the American bail-out of Mexico in 1994 or indeed the bail-out of its own banks in 2008. In an ideal world, voters would feel solidarity with those of other countries; generally, they don&rsquo;t. There are lots of English-speaking economists berating the Germans for what they have done to the Greeks; the American and British governments have also been insistent that the EU reach a deal. When it comes to practical help, however, the answer is rather different; Britain has just turned down the idea of using EU-wide funds to help Greece. Why? Because such a suggestion would be politically toxic in Britain. That&rsquo;s democracy in action for you.",
