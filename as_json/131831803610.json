He succeeded in leaving Voldemort almost mortal once again, but heâs not around to kill him anymore. So as the battle rages on, itâs up to the survivors to end Voldemort once and for all.</p>\n<p>Neville takes out Nagini and strips away Voldyâs last protection.</p>\n<p>Molly takes out Bellatrix and strips away Voldyâs last lieutenant.</p>\n<p>His rage is boundlesss, but his curses canât hold.</p>\n<p>And into the void steps Ginny. The first Weasley daughter in over a century, the seventh child of a seventh child, the girl more familiar with the inner workings of Voldemortâs soul than anyone else alive. Protected by Harryâs sacrifice, fearless and burning with righteous fury, she takes the stage.</p>\n<p>And at long last, Ginevra Weasley has her triumph over Tom Riddle.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Yes</p>\n</blockquote>",
