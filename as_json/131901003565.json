Been working on this one for a little while.</p>\n<p>Orcas are such facinating animals. They are the second most-widely distributed mammal on the planet (after humans), and they fill an ecological niche similar to our own. Not only do they vary widely in diet, dialects, and cultural behaviors, but in appearances as well. Again, much like humans :)</p>\n<p>We often look at dorsal fins and saddle patches for telling individuals and populations apart. But thereâs a TON of variation in rostrum shape, eyepatch size, and ventral markings as well. Just look at all these different orca faces!</p>\n<p>I tried to cover a broad range of ecotypes and individuals to show all the variation orcas can have, but I came to realize during my research that thereâs <i>a lot</i> more than I initially thought. That being the case, I may go back and add a few more individuals later (possibly even a few wild-caught captives like Nord and Gudrun, since they are so unique in addition to being from known, or sort-of known, populations).<br/></p>\n<p>If anyone happens to spot any errors as well, please let me know!</p>\n</blockquote>",
