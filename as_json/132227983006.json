There was always a doubt that it would work the same way that it did in my mind. When they sent me pictures of the construction, sometimes I wouldnât even open the emails. Iâd just move the images to a folder named âBridge.â Itâs surreal that this once existed in my mind. Iâve seen it one million times on a computer monitor. I know every single one of these pipes, and I remember the moment that I decided where to place them. Now I am so much smaller than something that once only existed in my imagination. I can stand inside of it. It feels like being inside a movie that you directed or a book that you wrote. And you canât help but feel powerful.â <br/><br/>ââââââââââââ-<br/><br/><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/la.leila.la.leila\">Leila Araghian</a> is the young architect behind Tehranâs recently completed Tabiat Bridge. Construction of the bridge was completed in 2014 despite the difficulties of international sanctions. The bridge has become a cultural and physical centerpiece of Tehran, and Leila captured the imagination of the architecture world by winning the right to design it at the age of 26. <br/><br/>(3/3)<br/>(Tehran, Iran)<br/><br/></p>\n</blockquote>",
