Perfectionism is not about healthy striving, which you see all the time in successful leaders, itâs not about trying to set goals and being the best we can be, perfectionism is basically a cognitive behavioral process that says if I look perfect, work perfect, and do everything perfectly, I can avoid shame, ridicule, and criticism. Itâs a defense mechanism.",
