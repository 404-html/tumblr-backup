   "quote-text" : "It is a common misconception, that the terrorists are trying to [convert us to their religion]. If that was their purpose, they would use entirely different means of persuasion. No, the purpose is the exact opposite; To turn us against Islam. To turn us against muslims. Because by doing that, we will support their tale of how a war exists between the west and Islam. In that way we strengthen their attempt of recruiting even more muslims for their sick and suppressing community of violence.Â <br/>\nThis is why itâs more important than ever, that we loud and clear declare; we are NOT at war with Islam! We are NOT at war with the 1,6 billion muslims of the world. We ARE at war with a few fundamentalists, who are trying to drag an entire world religion and a fourth of the worldâs population under their black wings. This cannot happen. We cannot hand them that victory. In this war all peace-loving muslims are our most important allies. Together we fight for our freedom. Only together can we win.",
