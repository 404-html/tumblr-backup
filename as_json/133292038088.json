   "quote-text" : "<p>In 1914, Patrick Geddes arrived in Madras, India, in the waning phase of a plague pandemic that had killed 10 million people on the subcontinent. Geddes, a pioneer of urban planning from Scotland, had been invited to lecture on his ideas and, later, to evaluate the government&rsquo;s draconian proposal to &lsquo;sanitize&rsquo; cities through slum clearance, street widening and the installation of public latrines.</p>\n\n<p>Geddes did something surprising. After four years visiting dozens of cities across India, he produced a series of reports extolling the superiority of native urbanism over British idÃ©es fixes. He concluded that the official sanitation crusade was a huge threat to the cultural and environmental foundations of Indian town life. He prescribed âconservative surgeryâ: providing communities with the resources to cleanse and repair themselves, improve rather than remove slums, and plant gardens in demolition sites. He advocated collecting human waste and trenching it in public vegetable and fruit gardens, rather than dumping it into streams or latrines.</p>\n\n<p>His ideas achieved small-scale successes in Lucknow, Baroda and Indore. The larger urban-reform movement in India collapsed after the First World War, in part because of the immense cost of building New Delhi on an imperial scale.</p>",
