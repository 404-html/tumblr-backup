   "quote-text" : "<p>But remember, N-amino azidotetrazole (I can&rsquo;t even type that name without wincing) is the starting material for the work I&rsquo;m talking about today. Itâs a base camp, familiar territory, merely a jumping-off point in the quest for still more energetic compounds. The most alarming of them has two carbons, fourteen nitrogens, and no hydrogens at all, a formula that even KlapÃ¶tke himself, who clearly has refined sensibilities when it comes to hellishly unstable chemicals, calls &ldquo;exciting&rdquo;. Trust me, you donât want to be around when someone who works with azidotetrazoles comes across something &ldquo;exciting&rdquo;.</p>\n\n<p>It&rsquo;s a beast, all right. The compound is wildly, ridiculously endothermic, with a heat of formation of 357 kcal/mole, all of which energy is ready to come right back out at the first provocation (see below). To add to the fun, the X-ray crystal structure shows some rather strange bond distances, which indicate that there&rsquo;s a lot of charge separation &mdash; the azides are somewhat positive, and the tetrazole ring somewhat negative, which is a further sign that the whole thing is trembling on the verge of not existing at all.</p>\n\n<p>And if you are minded to make some yourself, then you are on the verge of not existing at all, either.</p>",
