It is literally called âswooping seasonâ and these birds will fly down to peck your fucking face, and people get their eyes ripped out and shit, itâs fucking brutal.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>My teacher had to go to hospital and have surgery because of swooping season. It was in the parking lot of school and all the kids would do a mad dash towards the car as the magpies tried to kill us.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>no but when youâre 12 years old and riding your bike like mad on the way home from school with an icecream bucket on your head with like branches and shit sticking out if it to scare them offÂ <em>and none of this is considered strange</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><em>what the actual fuck australiaÂ </em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I am pretty sure all of these Australia stories are a massive, globally-spanning trolling effort, and only the people who have visited the country are allowed to be in on the joke.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Nope.</p>\n<p>Went there.</p>\n<p>Parrots tried to take our car.</p>\n<p>Came home IN A FUCKING HURRY.<br/></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Interesting thing about magpies - theyâre not great at identifying individual humans visually, but if you make yourself identifiable in some way theyâre usually open to reason. We used to have some very aggressive swoopers in our back yard - as soon as they realised that the humans *inside* the fence never bothered them and were the source of the delicious compost heap, they turned into flying black and white guard dogs who would viciously assault any passing stranger but never bothered anyone inside the yard. Several times they swooped at us when we approached from outside, then when we walked into the yard they would pull up and act incredibly apologetic like<i> sorry maâam I had no idea it was you I would never please donâtÂ stop stocking the food pile.</i><br/></p>\n<p>There was another little group of magpies in the park who would attack any solo pedestrian but never bothered anyone walking a dog or pushing a pram, because apparently those were identifiable traits indicating a non-threatening human. In the spirit of inquiry, I started going out of my way to be polite to the magpies - carefully walking a wide arc around them when they were on the ground, etc - and emitting an identifiable call ofÂ âhello birdieâ before swooping season started.Â </p>\n<p>I spent the next ten years crossing that park at least once a day and as long as I turned at the first flutter of wings and saidÂ âhello birdieâ to the magpie waiting to attack as soon as my back was turned, I was fine. Every time, the magpie would stare at me for a minute and then fly off to harass some other pedestrian because apparently the magpies and I, we were cool.Â </p>\n<p>Parrots are a lot less open to negotiation, and the little bastards travel in flocks. Beware the parrots.Â </p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>What the fuck</p>\n</blockquote>",
