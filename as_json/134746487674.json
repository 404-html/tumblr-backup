The verdict? The newcomers had âlots of fun,â according to social worker Nicole Kranebitter.</p>\n<p>The migrants âwill now know what to expect when St. Nicholas and the Krampus creatures knock on their door,â Kranebitter added.</p>\n<p>She said the next event planned for the families who fled war-torn homelands will be traditional cookie baking.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>sometimes the world is okay</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Bless them for thinking ahead and making sure the new residents understood wtf would be going on with the Christmas Devils.Â </p>\n<p>This is a sitcom waiting to happen.Â </p>\n</blockquote>",
