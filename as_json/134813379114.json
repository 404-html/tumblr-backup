   "quote-text" : "Part of the fun of Casablanca is waiting for Rick to inevitably become a hero. But waiting for Sam Lowry to try to make the same move is more like watching a babysitter in a slasher film set out to explore the dark basement. At the beginning of the movie, daydreams provide Sam with some respite from the awfulness around him, and that&rsquo;s all they do. It&rsquo;s once he convinces himself that he really is the kind of hero he dreams about, and tries to assume that mantle, that things go terribly wrong for him. At the film&rsquo;s end, he&rsquo;s still relying on fantasy as a shield from the horribleness of his existence, but his existence is orders of magnitude more horrible and he&rsquo;s gotten everyone he cares about killed. So to me, to the extent the movie was about fantasy at all, it was about the danger of confusing fantasy with the real world. From my perspective, Sam&rsquo;s dreams are no more important than Kurtzmann&rsquo;s incompetence, or Spoor and Dowser&rsquo;s petty triumphs; just another way to bear the unbearable. And maybe a riskier coping mechanism than anyone else&rsquo;s, at least in the Ministry of Information. Dreams don&rsquo;t leave a paper trail.",
