   "quote-text" : "[Paul] Graham is right. Thereâs no way to automate this stuff. It requires intelligence and EQ and social toil; again, precisely the work that the engineering side rarely understands, and that the economic/journalistic nexus of Silicon Valley often actively ignores or disparages. Technology culture usually venerates the âviralâ success, the app or service that just sort of explodes on its own by dint of sheer fabulosity. These stories exist, but theyâre pretty rare. Scratch the surface of an outta-nowhere successful technology, get past the mythic sold-to-investors creation story, and you often find some hard-slogging social work and marketing.",
