   "quote-text" : "Writing a program and then running it is magic, in a way. The numbers, letters and symbols of code are transmuted into instructions executed by microscopic circuits to achieve the desired results. Pixels appear on the screen; lifts move; airline tickets are ordered; lists are sorted; e-mails are delivered. But just because the results seem magical does not mean that coding is mysterious and inaccessible. Indeed, one of the joys of coding is that computers are the opposite of mysterious: they operate in an unforgivingly predictable, consistent and deterministic manner. Most people do not need to be able to write code to do their jobs, any more than they need to be able to speak foreign languages or do algebra. But it is useful to have some basic experience in coding, and not just to demystify how computers work. As Marc Andreessen, the co-creator of the Netscape web browser, likes to say, in future there will be two kinds of jobs: those that involve telling computers what to do, and those that involve being told what to do by computers. Worried that your job is in danger of being automated away by software? Learning to code could be a useful insurance policy. Even if youâre not, it can also be fun.",
