   "quote-text" : "In the past, when I asked my friends about their faults, they said things that didn&rsquo;t count: They got frustrated sometimes or worked too much. These conversations inevitably ended with me saying, &ldquo;Those arenât bad enough,&rdquo; and storming away. They didnât say what I wanted to hear. That deep down, they weren&rsquo;t sure if they were likable. That they were so irresponsible, they couldn&rsquo;t imagine being mothers. They didn&rsquo;t say they craved attention but had trouble giving it to others. They didn&rsquo;t say how cruel they could be. These were surely the flaws he had seen in me.",
