   "quote-text" : "This imbalance translates into extreme wariness about the customers who wield the ratings. The dozen Uber drivers I spoke with &ndash; all of whom requested anonymity &ndash; said they were skittish about whom they picked up, not based on what their customer ratings were, but on signs that they might give harsh ratings. Some avoided five-star passengers because it meant they were new and might not know that anything less than five stars is a failing grade. Others said that if they got stuck in traffic or the rider placed the location pin wrong, they&rsquo;d cancel the ride rather than risk deactivation from a customer who&rsquo;d be annoyed at the outset. If the riders are holding red solo cups or look like they might try to cram too many people in the car, drivers cancel rather than get rated down for telling them no. You have to be careful who you pick up, one driver told me. &ldquo;Once you start the ride, you&rsquo;re screwed, you put all the power in the customerâs hands.&rdquo; Drivers joke about the way riders sit in the back seat following their route on Google maps, silently monitoring whether theyâre staying on course. If they take a wrong turn, drivers sometimes comp the rest of the trip &ndash; nice for the rider, but a significant loss for the driver, who has to choose between working for free or risking deactivation. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re in a state of neurotic anxious terror of making the tiniest slip up,&rdquo; said one driver.",
