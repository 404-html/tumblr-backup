   "quote-text" : "<p>In the 21st century the villagers still came to pay their respects, though not to the palace. That had long been turned into a high school for shrill dark-plaited girls. For his last 28 years the house of Brajraj, still most royal, was a small hut of mud on a hillock with an asbestos roof that thundered and leaked under the monsoon rains. He lived there alone. His furniture was a wooden cot under a torn tarpaulin, a few plastic chairs, a battery-powered fan and rails, thick with cobwebs, on which to hang his clothes. As for those, they were no longer the best embroidered sherwanis, gem-heavy necklaces, cummerbunds, scabbards and jewelled turbans in which he would attend a durbar or, with a lordly expression, pose with one two-tone shoe on a gilt stool for the photographer. He now wore a humble kurta and lungi over his bony hips. He had been plump in the old days. Now he pecked at what his subjects served him: tea and a couple of biscuits in the morning, a little dal and rice for lunch, a roti at night. His eyes were so clouded with cataracts that he felt, rather than saw, what was placed before him.</p>\n\n<p>[&hellip;]</p>\n\n<p>If he left the hut now it was in a rickshaw, not a motor, pulled jolting by one man over the mud tracks from one village to another. He did not complain. The aura of attentiveness and reverence about him was as strong as ever, his people as loyal to &ldquo;Sir&rdquo; as before. Only the trappings had changed. He now preferred to be his subjects&rsquo; aaja, grandfather, rather than their raja; his one command was that each villager should pay ten rupees for his cremation when the time came. He awaited it with patience, his gaunt hands knotted round his walking stick as, in former times, they had clasped the still-warm barrel of his trusty hunting-rifle. He was content with both the future and the past. As he told one journalist preparing yet another &ldquo;Prince to Pauper&rdquo; feature, if he was unhappy, how could he have lived so long?</p>",
