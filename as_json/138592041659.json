Jumping rope or playing hopscotch or just making up a game by using our imagination (I think it usually involved hitting each other with sticks we found). Then, somewhere around sixth grade, they had us start playing organized sports, and everyone started taking it <i>really seriously</i>. Recess was replaced by gym, and Iâll never for the rest of my life forget the gym teacher getting enraged when I dropped a pop fly during softball, allowing the winning run to score. I mean, it ruined his freaking day. He stared at me like he wanted to murder me â it was a look of loathing. The fact that I hadnât spent my spare time getting good at softball meant I was a worthless piece of shit and that I had failed at life.</p>\n<p>I thought he was just a psychopath â¦ then saw that everyone else was on his side.</p>\n<p>\n\nJust like that, play time went from fun to competitive, from inventing reasons to laugh with your friends to participating in a tense, hateful contest that made participants so enraged that they would physically fight over disputed calls and narrow losses. And then, I saw that suddenly everything was like that.\n\n<br/></p>\n<h2><b><a href=\"http://www.cracked.com/blog/7-ways-you-can-accidentally-become-social-outcast/\">7 Ways You Can Accidentally Become A Social Outcast</a></b></h2>\n</blockquote>",
