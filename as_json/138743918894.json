[/s]</p></blockquote>\n<p>So, this retired rodent had managed to sneak past University\nof Reading security, exterior doors and Museum staff, and clambered its way up into our Store. Upon\nfinding itself there it would have found the promised land; a mouse paradise\nlaid before it full of straw, wood and textiles. Then, out of thousands of\nobjects, it chose for its home the very thing designed to kill it some 150\nyears ago: a mouse trap.</p>\n<figure data-orig-width=\"1024\" data-orig-height=\"683\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"http://66.media.tumblr.com/4a35775c66d982e261b907b8c4bb0aa8/tumblr_inline_o1z03kcSnp1slgfk9_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"1024\" data-orig-height=\"683\"/></figure><p>The trap itself was not baited, but this did not stop our\nmouse from wriggling inside and, finding itself trapped, meet its demise. The trap\nwas manufactured by Colin Pullinger &amp; Sons of Silsey, West Sussex in 1861.\nIt is a multi-catch trap with a see-saw mechanism, and <a href=\"http://www.reading.ac.uk/adlib/Details/collect/16893\">you can see its object\nrecord here</a>. It is known as a âPerpetual Mouse Trapâ and proudly declares that\nit âwill last a lifetimeâ. How apt.</p>\n<figure data-orig-width=\"1024\" data-orig-height=\"696\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"http://40.media.tumblr.com/b5f3839ee72be7f0de7df18f833cd03a/tumblr_inline_o1z03tYWif1slgfk9_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"1024\" data-orig-height=\"696\"/></figure><p>Pests are, of course, a perpetual menace in any museum.\nCurators and conservators are always alert for the tell-tale signs of moths,\nbeetles and rodents which feast on the organic materials we hold in store. Hygiene\nand regular cleaning are a first line of defence, as are glazed cases. Objects\nare also treated before storage or display to ensure anything lurking within is\nkilled. And while our most vulnerable objects have always been cased â such as\nclothing and leather â the rest of our stored collection made of sturdier wood\nand metal was only fully glazed over last year. This mouse may have snuck into\nthe trap before this glazing, or otherwise managed to get in while construction\nwork has been carried out for the Museumâs redevelopment.</p>\n<figure data-orig-width=\"1024\" data-orig-height=\"467\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"http://41.media.tumblr.com/d99ecfa1b1168d307af5dcda9d6fece7/tumblr_inline_o1z045qlNM1slgfk9_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"1024\" data-orig-height=\"467\"/></figure><p>We have traps set for pests, but we can never catch\neverything all of the time. This mouse managed to sign its own death warrant\nbefore it could do any more damage, the extent of which was only a nibbled\nlabel. We will also have to determine whether this mouse was a scout or part of\na larger family. Luckily, because the collection is heavily used it is often only\na matter of time before any kind of infestation is noticed and nipped in the\nbud. This mouse was found when our Assistant Curator was in the Stores selecting objects for\nuse in an interdisciplinary research session on the subject of âAnimals at\nReadingâ. Our current MERL Fellow, Professor Karen Sayer, is also particularly\ninterested in traps as part of her ongoing research into rats and pest control\nand regularly views our collection. </p>\n<figure data-orig-width=\"1024\" data-orig-height=\"683\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"http://40.media.tumblr.com/468db007aeeac628352f2d96d33947c6/tumblr_inline_o1z04hCu1Z1slgfk9_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"1024\" data-orig-height=\"683\"/></figure><p>For the moment, however, the mouse remains in the trap while\nwe decide what to do with it. One option is a dignified burial, another is to desiccate\nit or have it prepared to remain as a permanent feature of the mouse trap for\nour new displays. Weâll let you know what we decide.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\nWow: mouse sneaks into museum, is caught by a 155 year old trap, starves to death.",
