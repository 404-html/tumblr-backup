You could even boost your self-esteem by becoming one of those condescending assholes whoâs fluent in public transportation and judges everyone who isnât. âDid you hear that noob ask if the A was running express? Who doesnât know that at 11 p.m. every other Wednesday, the A transforms into a commemorative plaque of Kanyeâs VMA speech?â (Answer: probably a noob who knows how to parallel park.)\n\n<br/></p>\n<p>\n\nAll of that false bravado would vanish as soon as I ventured outside of the city: to visit friends in the suburbs, while on vacation, or anytime the words âroad tripâ came up. During these jaunts away from comfort, I would regress into a hapless backseat child, whose schedule was dictated by whoever my adoptive driving parents happened to be that week. These temporary bursts of humility made me long for New York, where I was no less outwardly incompetent than anyone else. Whenever one of these trips came to an end, I returned home with a sense of calm, knowing I would soon regain control over my life.\n\n<br/></p>\n<h2><b><a href=\"http://www.cracked.com/blog/5-harsh-realities-being-adult-who-doesnt-drive/\">5 Harsh Realities Of Being An Adult Who Doesnât Drive</a></b></h2>\n</blockquote>",
