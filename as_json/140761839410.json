   "answer" : "<p>yeah sure on sec i gotta get pic-<i>oh my god hold on</i>Â when i was googling for pictures I came across something <i>else</i>.<i>Â </i>I would go to jail if I didnât tell you guys about this animal <i>immediately</i>Â it would be that much of a crime against humanity.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"520\" data-orig-height=\"340\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"http://56.media.tumblr.com/386a1c3bba22ab2f7078d4a68c8d720a/tumblr_inline_o1ysl6BXzj1shl8uw_540.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"520\" data-orig-height=\"340\"/></figure><figure data-orig-width=\"1024\" data-orig-height=\"768\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"http://56.media.tumblr.com/89f996eea7b5d9ffc8c2de335e715de2/tumblr_inline_o1ysq3FYfF1shl8uw_540.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"1024\" data-orig-height=\"768\"/></figure><p><b>there is nothing i can say about this animal to do it justice. <i>nothing</i>.</b></p><p>This is the Mary River Turtle, <i>Elusor macrurus</i>. Itâs critically endangered due to dams and that would be a <i>damn</i>Â shame because this is the most punk rock animal Iâve ever seen. They donât all have the moss hairdos, but theyâre all this punk rock on the inside.Â </p><p>Anyways, Irwinâs Turtle! I bet you can guess who<i>Â Elseya irwini</i> is named after!</p><figure data-orig-width=\"640\" data-orig-height=\"420\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"http://56.media.tumblr.com/1db163a7b97adbc68b42356182a1a0d5/tumblr_inline_o1yszxZ0FJ1shl8uw_540.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"640\" data-orig-height=\"420\"/></figure><p>Thatâs right, Steve Irwin! Steve and his folks were on this camping trip and his dad was fishing and he caught this thing and they sent snaps of it to John Cann- who actually, he kinda comes up in the <a href=\"http://kaijutegu.tumblr.com/post/138595338253/hey-seeing-as-exotic-reptiles-are-illegal-in\">last post</a> I made, as heâs the fella Cannâs side-necked turtle is named after- and John Cann was all âWOAH, thatâs a new turtle!â and so we have this super rare, super amazing turtle named after Steve Irwin. And this turtle can do some really amazing things.Â </p><p>Amazing Thing the First: This turtle has a <i>built-in hat</i>.Â </p><figure data-orig-width=\"640\" data-orig-height=\"420\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"http://56.media.tumblr.com/f7d8f714c16fc7a35c0c841955207782/tumblr_inline_o1yt1pKeY71shl8uw_540.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"640\" data-orig-height=\"420\"/></figure><p>Itâs got this little golden crown built in so that nobody will ever confuse it for a peasant amongst turtles.</p><p>Amazing Thing the Second: It only lives in part of one river and as a result is facing extinctio- wait, no, thatâs not amazing at all. Why does Australia keep damming up all its turtle rivers? Damn your dam, youâre throwing away biodiversity and <i>a turtle with a built-in crown</i>! They have it hard enough, what with the crocodiles and the dang goannas eating their eggs!</p><figure data-orig-width=\"275\" data-orig-height=\"183\"><img src=\"http://56.media.tumblr.com/a04092ca3b7ac52ec47780ba00158288/tumblr_inline_o1yt7xcnFB1shl8uw_540.png\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"275\" data-orig-height=\"183\"/></figure><p>Amazing Thing the Third:Â him breathe out own ass.. w</p><p>Yes, itâs true; Irwinâs turtle is a <i>bimodal</i>Â breather. That means that instead of just breathing out their nostrils like us plebs, this majestic beast can take water into its cloaca and actually <i>breathe</i>Â that way. Thereâs a gill-like structure in a chamber just past the cloaca and while they usually breathe normally, they can respire quite well through their cloaca. Thereâs other turts that can do it, too- both new world and old world species- but none of <i>them</i>Â have a <i>crown</i>.</p><p>Image sources: <a href=\"http://www.sunshinecoastdaily.com.au/news/australia-protected-areas-congress/345458/\">1</a>, <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/chrisvanwyksadventures/1490129493\">2</a>, <a href=\"http://www.aqua.org/explore/animals/irwins-turtle\">3, 4</a>, <a href=\"http://urannah.com.au/elseya-irwini-irwins-turtle/\">5</a>,</p>",
