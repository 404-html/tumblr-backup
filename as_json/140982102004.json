So the big banana producers all started growing the same cultivar - the Gros Michel - and they deliberately inbred that sucker until every banana they picked was essentially identical to every other.</p>\n<p>The upshot is that all commercially cultivated bananas suffered from the same weakened immune system, and when a fungal pathogen that could kill <b>one</b> Gros Michel banana plant evolved, it promptly killed <b>all</b> of them.</p>\n<p>And the punchline? The banana producers didnât learn a blessed thing from all this. Instead of diversifying their banana crops, they switched to a new cultivar, the Cavendish, <i>en masse</i> - and todayâs Cavendishes are just as inbred as the Gros Michel was back in the day.</p>\n<p>Indeed, a second âbanana apocalypseâ is brewing as we speak; in 2008, a new strain of the same fungus that wiped out the Gros Michel, one thatâs capable of attacking the Cavendish, struck banana crops in Malaysia - and in spite of our best efforts to contain it, itâs spreading. According to some estimates, if banana production isnât diversified soon, the Cavendish could follow the Gros Michel into commercial extinction in as little as ten years.</p>\n<p>Isnât history fun?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>banana apocalypse 2 coming to a banana farm near you.</p>\n</blockquote>",
