   "quote-text" : "Take a minute to process this. As a bipartisan proposal to bring entitlement spending under control, raising the retirement age to 67 or 70 will enlist the working poor to pay into the system for a few more years, curtailing their retirement years to the single digits, while the taxes they pay will flow into Social Security checks for the wealthier and healthier. A senior with a fatter bank account wins twice &ndash; with greater longevity and more years drawing Social Security checks &ndash; while the poor work longer, live fewer years and collect less in benefits.",
