   "quote-source" : "The Economist, <a href=\"http://www.economist.com/blogs/democracyinamerica/2013/03/gay-marriage-and-abortion\"><em>A hard Roe to hoe</em></a>, March 22, 2013.",
   "quote-text" : "<p>So who is right: Mr Barro or Justice Ginsburg. Well, take a look at the arguments made by the same-sex marriage opponents profiled on Wednesday by Ashley Parker. They take Roe as an inspiration, an example of how one side can lose a decisive battle yet fight on in a long war. Caitlin Seery says, &ldquo;When you de-link marriage from childbearing, you then have to increase the complexity of that relationship.&rdquo; I assume, then, that Ms Seery opposes not just same-sex marriage, but also marriages among heterosexuals past child-bearing age, and indeed heterosexual marriages that do not produce children. I eagerly await her proposed constitutional amendment requiring married couples to procreate. Ryan Anderson, a Heritage Fellow, makes a similar argument based on reproduction, which is fine, but why then does it not apply to non-procreative heterosexuals? He also frets that same-sex marriage &ldquo;exclude[s] sexual complementarity&rdquo; &ndash; the old argumentum ad genitalium, that gays&rsquo; equipment doesn&rsquo;t fit right. Not to dwell too long on the bedroom, but I presume committed gay couples have found a way to be sexually complementary (and probably sexually complimentary too!). This argument requires opposing sodomy for heterosexuals too, which Mr Anderson does not do. Apparently non procreative sex is only wrong when gays do it.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, Joseph Backholm complains of same-sex supporters &ldquo;fram[ing] this as a vote for gay people to be happy.&rdquo; Well, yes. It is a vote for gay people to have the same defining, challenging, fulfilling, frustrating, enriching, beautiful and complete marital relationships that the rest of us have. And that is a fundamental difference between same-sex marriage and abortion. Everybody loves a wedding; nobody likes an abortion. Supporters of abortion rights simply believe that safe, legal and rare is better than unsafe, illegal and rare. The better analogy for same-sex marriage is, of course, interracial marriage. Some people still don&rsquo;t like it. Fine. They can marry within their own race and grumble impotently at the TV. But what they can&rsquo;t do is tell anyone else who to love and who to marry. Same-sex marriage supporters frame the case as a vote for gay people to be happy because that is precisely what it is.</p>",
