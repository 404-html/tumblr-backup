   "quote-text" : "I saw you, Walt Whitman, childless, lonely old grubber, poking among the meats in the refrigerator and eyeing the grocery boys.<br/>\n I heard you asking questions of each: Who killed the pork chops? What price bananas? Are you my Angel?<br/>\n I wandered in and out of the brilliant stacks of cans following you, and followed in my imagination by the store detective.<br/>\n We strode down the open corridors together in our solitary fancy tasting artichokes, possessing every frozen delicacy, and never passing the cashier.",
