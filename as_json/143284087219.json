   "quote-text" : "Two peoples who would cross that single dividing ocean, the Irish to freedom, the Africans to slavery. My own daughters have the blood of both peoples, Irish and Africans, running through their veins and that makes them something more powerful â it makes them Americans. All of us came from someplace else. Americaâs made of generations of men and woman who crossed oceans and borders to come here, some in extraordinarily dire circumstances. Tireless waves of immigrants from Ireland, yes, but also from Italy, and Germany, Russia, and China, South East Asia, and Latin America, and Africa. And many set down roots and became some of our most influential citizens. We encourage the latest generation of eligible immigrants, some 8.8 million permanent residents including many Irish to take the same step in their American journey. Many are students who except for the circumstances of their birth are as American as my own daughters and Joeâs children and grandchildren, students who bravely came out as undocumented in the hopes that they could earn the right to become citizens and make a difference in the country that they love. Our neighbors, our classmates, our friends â they did not come here in search of a free ride. They came to work, to study, to serve in our military, and above all to contribute to our success. That is the American Dream and the American Dream is something that no wall will ever contain.",
