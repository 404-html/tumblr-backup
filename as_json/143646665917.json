Thereâs going to be a Squirrel Girl original graphic novel! Iâm so proud of our girl.<br/></p><p><b>THE UNBEATABLE SQUIRREL GIRL BEATS UP THE MARVEL UNIVERSE! OGN</b><br/>Written by Ryan North<br/>Art and cover by Erica Henderson<br/>Proof that weâre living in the best of all possible worlds: THEREâS GONNA BE A SQUIRREL GIRL GRAPHIC NOVEL!<br/>Itâs\n a stand-alone adventure thatâs both great for new Squirrel Girl \nreaders, and also for people who ALREADY know about how she can talk to \nsquirrels and also punch really well!<br/>Behold: a story so HUGE it \ndemanded a graphic novel! A story so NUTS that it incorporates BOTH \nsenses of that word (insanity AND the weird hard fruit thingies) \n(theyâre fruits, did you know that?) (I didnât until I looked them up \njust now, so looks like weâre all learning science from this solicit \ntext for a comic book!)<br/>Squirrel Girl has defeated Thanos, Galactus, \nand Doctor Doom. TWICE. But in this all-new graphic novel, sheâll \nencounter her most dangerous, most powerful, most unbeatable enemy yet: \nHERSELF.<br/>Specifically, an evil duplicate made possible through mad \nscience (both computer and regular) as well as some Bad Decisions. In \nother words, SQUIRREL GIRL BEATS UP THE MARVEL UNIVERSE!<br/></p></blockquote>\n\n<p>I cannot believe how awesome this is</p></blockquote>",
