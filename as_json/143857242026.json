   "answer" : "<p>The depth of my love for <b>paleoart from the 19th century</b> knows no limits.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"800\" data-orig-height=\"551\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"http://66.media.tumblr.com/b4c9705421960fbcf5a02da755c2f271/tumblr_inline_o4odfwNtrQ1qdikaa_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"800\" data-orig-height=\"551\"/></figure><p>This image, titled â<i>Duria Antiquior</i>â (âAncient Dorsetâ), was painted in 1830 by English geologist Henry De la Beche, and was the first piece of art to reconstruct prehistoric creatures using evidence from fossils, effectively making it <b>the first piece of true paleoart.</b> Â Even today, we can recognize these animals as icthyosaurs, plesiosaurs, and pterosaurs.</p><p>De la Becheâs vision of Jurassic-period England was a hellish nightmare, a continuous bloodbath of bug-eyed demons gnashing one anotherâs flesh. Â I absolutely love it. Â Itâs not up to modern scientific standards, but aesthetically, itâs a dream world.</p><figure data-orig-width=\"1021\" data-orig-height=\"829\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"http://66.media.tumblr.com/0bd98c05be82c6c53a886a433fae83f2/tumblr_inline_o4odgePZhh1qdikaa_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"1021\" data-orig-height=\"829\"/></figure><p>Henry De la Beche was also the first paleoartist to propose <b>theoretical sentient descendants of prehistoric reptiles</b> - albeit in a joking way. Â Take that, Dale Russell! Â The caption reads as such:</p><blockquote><p>A Lecture. Â âYou will at once perceive,â continued Professor Icthyosaurus, âthat the skull before us belonged to some of the lower order of animals; the teeth are very insignificant, the power of the jaws trifling, and altogether it seems wonderful how the creature could have procured food.â<br/></p></blockquote><p>De la Becheâs lampooning of the popular view of extinct reptiles is still applicable today.</p><p>And paleoart from this time didnât just depict aquatic reptiles so amazingly. Â Take a look at Edouard Riouâs 1863 illustration, Â â<i>La terre avant le deluge</i>â (âThe Earth Before the Floodâ), depicting a battle between <i>Iguanodon</i> and <i>Megalosaurus.</i></p><figure data-orig-width=\"1024\" data-orig-height=\"646\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"http://67.media.tumblr.com/a2d5439d5b150fc66d03a15b5c842eee/tumblr_inline_o4odgyYmWw1qdikaa_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"1024\" data-orig-height=\"646\"/></figure><p>Even though this was scientifically accurate by the standards of the time, the scientist in me disapproves of the lizardly depictions of the animals. Â Aesthetically, though, isnât this brilliant? Â It continues the tradition of Henry De la Becheâs art, depicting ancient Earth as a constant battleground between reptilian behemoths, and sets these battles in the prototypical âprimordial worldâ - the setting people still think of when they think of dinosaur times. Â Look at those gloomy, foggy cycads! Â Makes me want to put on a pith helmet and go look for a stegosaur to bag with my blunderbuss.</p><p>(Edouard Riou, by the way, is best known for providing the original illustrations to several of Jules Verneâs novels, including Jules Verneâs Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea and Journey to the Center of the Earth. Â Spend some time on Google and familiarize yourself with his work!) </p><figure data-orig-width=\"960\" data-orig-height=\"601\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"http://66.media.tumblr.com/477b9dcb57d0f812a306419ac39e1123/tumblr_inline_o4odhcPcgW1qdikaa_540.jpg\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"960\" data-orig-height=\"601\"/></figure><p>The final image Iâll post here is Edward Drinker Copeâs 1869 illustration of the theropod <i>Dryptosaurus</i> (then known as <i>Laelaps</i>) confronting a pair of <i>Elasmosaurus</i>, while a cheerful-looking turtle and what Iâm told are supposed to be hadrosaurs frolic in the background. Â Literally everything about how these animals are reconstructed is incorrect, and yet thatâs part of the charm. Â As a scientific illustration, this earns nothing but disapproval from me, but as an almost romantic depiction of a lost world, where monsters roamed the foggy forests and soaked the seas with the blood of battle, itâs something I can 100% get behind. Â (Itâs no more of a fantasy as plucked-chicken dromaeosaurs swarming onto a hapless hadrosaur like a land-going pack of piranha, anyway.)</p><p>Do yourself a favor. Â Look up some paleoart from the 19th century. Â Go back to that lost world. Â Have a real adventure.</p>",
