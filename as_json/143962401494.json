   "quote-text" : "<p>Backed by a social media campaign, Boaty McBoatface easily topped an online poll with more than 124,000 votes although even the instigator of the Boaty name later apologized for his suggestion.</p>\n\n<p>However, the government decided that the state-of-the-art ship which is due to set sail in 2019 would be named after Sir David Attenborough, 89, famed for his BBC TV natural history programs which span six decades and whose name had attracted 11,000 votes.</p>\n\n<p>But the shipâs remotely operated undersea vehicle, which will collect samples from the deep waters of the Arctic and Antarctic, will be called Boaty McBoatface.</p>\n\n<p>âThe ship has captured the imaginations of millions, which is why weâre ensuring that the Boaty name lives on through the sub-sea vehicle that will support the research crew, and the polar science education program that will bring their work to life,â said Science Minister Jo Johnson.</p>",
