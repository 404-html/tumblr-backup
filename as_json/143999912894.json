Christmas, as we all know, is the standard by which time is measured among the poor, because itâs our yearly reminder that âHahaha! You ainât got jack shit!â Moving once a year was just something I grew up with, so it was weird when I started noticing in my teens that a whole lot of my unpoor friends didnât do that. They stayed in the same house. They didnât have to make new friends because they were uprooted and dropped into a new school. They had never tried to strap a mattress to the roof of a Ford Escort.</p><p>When you live like that, you become damn near a savant at packing. You see all of your shit as Tetris pieces, and youâre able to fill any box without a square inch of air remaining. Itâs like you gain the ability to bend time and space. But itâs not just the physical manipulation thatâs impressive. You gain the memory of a supercomputer. Even without the aid of labels, you could glance at a pile of 30 boxes and immediately pick out which ones are yours. âAre you looking for the scissors? Theyâre in the Lunchables box under the toilet paper. Third one on the middle row, next to the Tupperware container filled with live cats.â</p><p>Even today, if my landlord told me to get the hell out, I could have everything we own sitting in our new house in a matter of hours. Theyâd turn around for a second and then look back to find a cloud of smoke like the goddamn Road Runner.<br/></p><h2><b><a href=\"http://www.cracked.com/blog/5-unexpected-side-effects-being-poor/\">5 Unexpected Side Effects Of Being Poor</a></b></h2></blockquote>",
