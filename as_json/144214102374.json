   "answer" : "<p>We trained the dog so that when he wants out, he goes to the front door and waits. </p>\n\n<p>Somehow in his little golden retriever brain, he interpreted this to mean âgo to the front door, and lick it.â </p>\n\n<p>If heâs at the door, but isnât licking it, he doesnât need out, heâs just chilling. </p>\n\n<p>So, this was our routine - when he wants out, he goes to the front door, and licks it. And then we moved house, and he got very, very confused. </p>\n\n<p>He knew he had to go to the front door when he wants out, but this was a new house with obviously a door that was completely new to him. </p>\n\n<p>Despite our condo having only one door that leads outside, and him going out this very same door literally at least five times a day, every day, for about a yearâ¦he still has no idea where the front door is in this house. Absolutely no idea at all.</p>\n\n<p>Now whenever he needs out, he will go to any random door and start licking it. And I mean any door - the bathroom door, my bedroom door, my closet, the goddamn door of a kitchen cabinet, even. </p>\n\n<p>I donât know if heâs really smart or really dumb. Because clearly, he understands conceptually what a door is. I donât know if he thinks my closet or the kitchen cabinets lead to outside, or if heâs just hoping to find doggy Narnia, or if heâs just hopelessly given up on ever being able to find the door by himself and is just doing the best he can, but every goddamn time he wants out, heâs right there licking the glass door to the shower or something.</p>\n\n<p>He doesnât alert us he needs out any other way. So if you havenât seen him in a while, you have to search room by room until you find him with his tongue pressed up against the linen closet because he thinks outside might be that way.</p>\n\n<p>Heâs the biggest, dumbest dog I have ever met in my life and I could not love him any more. Heâs perfect.</p>",
