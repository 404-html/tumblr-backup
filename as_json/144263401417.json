Against it, are they?â</p>\n\n<p> Â  Â âItâs not as simple as that. Itâs not a black and white issue. There are so many shades of gray.â</p>\n\n<p> Â  Â âNope.â</p>\n\n<p> Â  Â âPardon?â</p>\n\n<p> Â  Â âThereâs no grays, only white thatâs got grubby. Iâm surprised you donât know that. And sin, young man, is when you treat people as things. Including yourself. Thatâs what sin is.â</p>\n\n<p> Â  Â âItâs a lot more complicated than thatââ</p>\n\n<p> Â  Â âNo. It ainât. When people say things are a lot more complicated than that, they means they are getting worried that they wonât like the truth. People as things, thatâs where it starts.â</p>\n\n<p> Â  Â âOh, Iâm sure there are worse crimesââ</p>\n\n<p> Â  Â âBut they starts with thinking about people as things â¦â</p>",
