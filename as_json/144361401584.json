   "quote-text" : "<p>Somewhere along the way you realize that the happiness of publication is fleeting. The second published book isnât quite as exciting as the first, maybe. Itâs chasing the dragon. The first high remains the craziest and best high. But what happens is, you get to be okay with that.</p>\n\n<p>Because at some point you recognize that this isnât why you write.</p>\n\n<p>This isnât why you tell stories. You tell stories because you like to tell stories, not because you like to sell books. Thatâs what gets you through. You marvel at the craft. You drown in the art. You roll around in it like a dog covering himself in sweet, sweet stink. Itâs not that you donât care about being published. Itâs not that the money is meaningless. The money is a lifeline. The money lets you do this in a bigger, more real way. But all the publishing piffle â the Amazon rankings, the guest blogs, the tweets and marketing and Kirkus reviews and drinking and existential dread â itâs all out there. Itâs extra. Itâs connected to it, but itâs not it.</p>\n\n<p>You do it because you love it.</p>\n\n<p>You do it because you want to be read.</p>\n\n<p>You tell stories because youâre a storyteller. And because stories matter.</p>",
