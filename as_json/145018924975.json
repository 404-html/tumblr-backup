The picture looked unremarkable, featuring a group of men who are likely soldiers over 20 yards away and obscured by bushes. All in all, itâs not great composition and the lighting is bad, in fact, itâs hard to tell whatâs going on in the picture at all, except, hang on, that scene looks familiar.\n\n</p><p>Ah yes, itâs only the most significant German army surrender in World War II and one of the most pivotal moments in modern history. The picture, it turns out, is the only color photo in existence documenting German command giving up Northwest Germany, the Netherlands and Denmark to the allies. Not even the Imperial War Museum in London has a color photograph of the occasion.</p><p>Apparently Ronald Playforth, who was a clerk for Field Marshal Bernard Montgomery (aka the badass accepting the surrender) took the picture from the bushes even though no one was supposed to be photographing the event. Then he tucked it away for <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2009/sep/16/second-world-war-colour-photographs\">64 years</a> and didnât tell anyone about it except his family. It wasnât until 2009 when his family finally decided to share the photo with the world, or more specifically, sell it to the highest bidder.</p><h2><b><a href=\"http://www.cracked.com/article_20335_6-mind-blowing-things-recently-discovered-from-wwii.html?wa_user1=1&amp;wa_user2=History&amp;wa_user3=article&amp;wa_user4=companion\">\n\n6 Mind-Blowing Things Recently Discovered From WWII\n\n</a></b></h2></blockquote>",
