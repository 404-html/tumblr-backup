No building stands alone as itâs always part of a larger agenda - what we call the city. Architecture is not just a singular object, but an object within the field - itâs the puzzle pieces coming together the form the puzzle itself. Every month we will share two city Overviews across our feeds!</p>\n\n<p>For our first post, weâre thrilled to feature one of our favorite cities - #Amsterdam. The canal system of the city - known as Grachten - is the result of considered urban planning. In the early 17th century, when immigration was at a peak, a comprehensive plan for the cityâs expansion was developed with four concentric half-circles of canals emerging at the main waterfront. In the centuries since, the canals have been used for defense, water management, and transport.</p>\n\n<p>You can also now use the hashtag #OverviewCityscapes on any Instagram post for a chance to be featured on the @dailyoverview or @superachitects feeds. Aerial shots of your home cities are encouraged!</p>\n\n<p>Source imagery: DigitalGlobe</p></blockquote>",
