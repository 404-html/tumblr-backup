To meet Muhammad Ali is to like him. To know him must be both pleasure and privilege. â¦Â  Muhammad Ali seems to possess a dynamic zest for living. You may see it erupt in the exciting spasms of the Ali Shuffle. Or watch it bud in a hug and squeeze of children, then blossom with a message of brotherly love.</p>\n<p>âMy conscience is happy,â he said. âIâm not scared of nuthin. Iâm a man of faith.â He talked like a man of faith. Evidently, he is acting like one, too. He has reportedly turned down millions of dollars in commercial and investment royalties due to his âstrict religious beliefs.â â¦ <br/></p>\n<p>âAnd we who declare ourselves to be righteous Muslims donât take part in wars. That rule was written before I was born, so itâs nuthin new. If Iâm not sincere about this whole thing, then Iâm crazy,â said Ali â¦ &ldquo;Iâm not on trial, justice is on trial.â <br/></p>\n<p>Still Ali has been tried and sentenced by a court of law for his convictions â for refusing to be inducted into the Army. The fighter could enter the Army and probably do virtually nothing but stage exhibition bouts. Yet he wonât, because he believes, he says, that he has more important work to do here and now. He is free on bond pending the outcome of his appeal.</p>\n<p>&quot;A Frankenstein was created during 300 years of slavery. Now itâs backfirin on ya,â he said. &quot;In the past, the black man has seen a white Santa Claus, a white Jesus and white angels. The colored angels were probably in the kitchen preparing milk and honey.â â¦<br/></p>\n<p>&quot;We believe in knowledge of self to overcome this slavery amnesia. People make the ghetto. A $4 billion project in the ghetto would be a hole in six months, because the black man does not have the knowledge of himself. A man must have this knowledge of himself before he can be free and know where heâs goin. My role as a Black Muslim minister is to teach the people, to make them better citizens. Weâll take âem off your back.â</p>\n<p>These comments and others concerning his future and attitudes were prompted by questions from the audience. He said that his future in boxing was âdead right now, because this Army thing is so serious.â<br/><br/></p>\n</blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n<p>RIP Muhammad Ali</p>\n</blockquote>",
