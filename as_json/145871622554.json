Such brutality is unconscionable, but as Americans we need to remain strong in the face of violence and intimidation, and resist giving in to despair. At times like this, we must pull ourselves up, hold our loved ones tight, block any legislation that would prevent suspected terrorists from purchasing guns, and say a prayer for the victims.</p><p>The loss of life in Florida came as a terrible shock to all Americans. The scope of this tragedyâ49 innocent people murdered in a single act of hatredâis almost impossible to comprehend. But does that mean we should give in and abandon our way of life? No. As always, when faced with these kinds of horrors, we must steel our resolve, comfort the families of those killed and wounded, and ensure that we continue to live under a system of laws in which anyone can easily purchase a semi-automatic weapon, no matter their possible ties to terrorist organizations.<br/></p><p>This is who we are as Americans.</p><p><b><a href=\"http://www.theonion.com/blogpost/times-we-need-pull-ourselves-hold-our-loved-ones-c-53086\">More</a></b>.</p></blockquote>",
