We joke about death all the time, but we don&rsquo;t actually know itâ¦ we don&rsquo;t actually accept it, regardless of what we might say; it&rsquo;s all just words. Ideas. Far off future. Thought and perception and elocution to be discarded lightly. But this? This is different. There is something horrifyingly real, here, horrifyingly final. A monumental loneliness that does not lend itself well to words.</p>\n\n<p>Death. Our own mortality staring us in the face, no escape.</p>",
