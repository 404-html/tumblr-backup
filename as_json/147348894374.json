The probeâs science instruments were off at the time of arrival, to reduce complications during a crucial, 35-minute-long orbital-insertion burn. The Juno team began turning some instruments on July 6; JunoCam was powered up on Sunday, NASA officials said.</p><p>Juno is currently cruising away from the planet, toward the more distant parts of a highly elliptical, 53-day orbit.</p><p> âJunoCam will continue to take images as we go around in this first orbit,â Juno co-investigator Candy Hansen, of the Planetary Science Institute in Tucson, Arizona, said in the same statement. âThe first high-resolution images of the planet will be taken on Aug. 27, when Juno makes its next close pass to Jupiter.â</p></blockquote></blockquote>",
