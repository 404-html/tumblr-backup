   "quote-text" : "So what, exactly, is a heat dome? It is essentially a bubble of high pressure that sits in the mid- to upper atmosphere and pushes warm air down toward the ground. The approaching one is notable for its size. Another thing you should know about the dome: Because it is a high-pressure mass, the air flows clockwise around it, so at the back of the air mass â like from 6 to 9 on a clock â the air flow is from south to north. So as the heat dome moves east across the country, it brings up hot, humid air from the Gulf of Mexico. In the Midwest, the heat domeâs effects will be compounded by an even-more-terrifying-sounding phenomenon called âcorn sweat.â Corn sweat is the release of water from plant leaves into the air, also known as evapotranspiration. That makes it even muggier. Like a jungle, except itâs a corn field. New York City has only a couple of very small corn fields. But we are an urban heat island, a place where heat-absorbing streets and buildings, and pollution, and all the people jammed together, can make it feel even hotter.",
