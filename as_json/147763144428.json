   "quote-text" : "If you&rsquo;re in a professional setting (like, say, you&rsquo;re the fucking President publicly addressing a colleague), you are welcome to compliment women on on anything with actual relevance to that woman&rsquo;s professional life. For instance, if you work in an office and a woman from IT fixes your computer, you may officially <em>go nuts</em> complimenting her on her computer-fixing skills! It is not appropriate, however, to compliment her on her boobs. Unless she fixed your computer with her boobs, in which case, loophole! Ka-ching.",
