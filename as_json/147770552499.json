   "answer" : "<p>Iâve had this in my inbox for a few days, and I was most likely going to ignore it, because I love it when ignorant people come to debate policy with me on anon.Â </p><p>But then I figured, nah, letâs use this as an educational opportunity. First of all, anon, what is âShirar lawâ? Is it some new kind of Pokemon Go rule I donât know about? Because I, as a Muslim, have no idea what youâre referring to.Â </p><p>Second, thanks so much for saying that I, a U.S. citizen and Muslim, should not be allowed to enter the U.S. You really seem to know a lot about the U.S. constitution, and you must have some secret interpretation of âCongress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereofâ that I missed in all my book learning. Actually, you betray a total lack of knowledge about Islam, the United States constitution, Muslims, and terrorism. In short, you sound like an ignorant, uneducated fool.Â </p><p>Third, you said thatÂ âmosques breed terrorists.â Actually, thatâs not true. If you looked at the enormous body of literature and scholarship on groups like ISIS, you would know that the majority of ISIS recruits are radicalized online. Furthermore, you would also know that those who behave as terrorists have <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/mehdi-hasan/jihadist-radicalisation-islam-for-dummies_b_5697160.html\">very little actual religious knowledge</a>, and that especially in the U.S., those who are closely affiliated with mosques and religious organizations are least likely to become radicalized or commit crimes.Â </p><p>Finally, Iâm really tired of what you, many of my colleagues in the media, our politicians and the general public know or understand aboutÂ âSharia law.â That is to say, virtually nothing. Sharia meansÂ âwayâ orÂ âpathâ and actually refers to the ways Muslims practice Islam. When I sayÂ âAssalamo Alaikumâ (peace be upon you) to a fellow Muslim, Iâm practicing Sharia. When I give charity as prescribed by my faith, Iâm practicing Sharia. When I refrain from backbiting and telling lies, Iâm practicing Sharia. When I say my daily prayers, Iâm practicing Sharia. Scary, I know.Â </p><p>Sorry, but Sharia is not a threat to Americaâs legal system. Anyone who thinks so is, well, sadly misinformed, at best. <a href=\"https://www.aclu.org/report/nothing-fear-debunking-mythical-sharia-threat-our-judicial-system\">Read this</a> if you want. I know, Iâm quoting the ACLU, so I must be a communist. Sorry, I just donât have time to google more resources.Â </p><p>I could go on, but Iâm tired, and frankly, why am I wasting time on some ignorant asshole who doesnât even have the courage to put their name by what they say? That said, I want to share a few links for anyone else who might be interested, and a good piece written in wake of Newt Gingrichâs idiotic comments about Sharia and religious tests for Muslims.Â </p><p><a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/5-facts-you-need-to-know-about-sharia-law_us_5788f567e4b03fc3ee507c01\">5 Things You Need To Know About Sharia Law</a></p><p><a href=\"http://www.dallasnews.com/opinion/latest-columns/20160719-5-myths-about-sharia-law-debunked-by-a-law-professor.ece\">5 Myths About Sharia Debunked By A Law Professor</a></p><p>This is what Omid Safi, director of the Duke Islamic Studies Center, <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/omidsafi/posts/10154400924258793\">wrote</a> about Sharia in response to Newt Gingrich the other day. Itâs instructive and useful, and hopefully youâll learn a thing or two:Â </p><blockquote><p>I wanted to share some thoughts on both the attack and the hateful xenophobic response of people like Newt Gingrich, talking about deporting Muslims in the minutes after the vile and repulsive terrorist attack.</p><p>As always, let us begin with condolences for the grieving and the families and loved ones of the dead. We need time to mourn, to grieve, to weep, and to sit with this immense sorrow. Our heartfelt condolences to the people of Nice and their loved ones, and families, as well as many visitors to this beautiful area. Whether it is Iraq or Syria, Bangladesh or Orlando, Istanbul or Brussels, Nigeria or Medina, or so many of the other places around this small planet, it hurts everywhere, everywhere.</p><p>We need to wait till a full investigation has taken place. In our rush to fill the political analysis vacuum, some of the first analysis is almost always premature (as was the case with both Omar Mateen and San Bernardino).</p><p>As far as the hateful comments of the Former Speaker of the House, Newt Gingrich, talking about deporting Muslims and asking for loyalty tests for Muslims by stating that we do not believe in the Shariâa, here are my seven initial responses:</p><p>1) Gingrichâs comments, coming before we have had to mourn and grieve, before the families of the horrible attack have had a chance to bury their loved ones, is nothing less than hateful political opportunism. It betrays both our own highest American ideals as stated in the US constitution, and reveals a complete and willful ignorance of what the Shariâa actually consists of.</p><p>2) Gingrich, like many before him, talks about the Sharia as if it is a codified ideology out there, without talking about whose sharia, which interpretation of Shariâa. Is he referring to Muslims prayers? Feeding the poor? Respecting oneâs parents? It is akin to speak of âAmerican valuesâ without specifying if one is talking about Martin Luther Kingâs America or KKKâs America.</p><p>3) In addition, going back over a thousand years, scholars of Islam have identified the âAimsâ or âGoalsâ of Shariâa [referred to as the Maqasid al-Shariâa] as preservation of âlife, family, property, learning, and honor.â Which aspect of this does Gingrich exactly object to? Also, what exactly would the former Speaker of the House want Muslims to do: stop praying, fasting?</p><p>4) The real issue, though is not that Gingrich is wrong on the Shariâa. Itâs that he is wrong on America, wrong on the American Constitution. Itâs as if the former is completely ignorant of the very basics of our constitution, which is based on the very notion of not applying religious tests.</p><p>I wonder if he is familiar with the very first Amendment of the US constitution: âCongress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the government for a redress of grievances.â</p><p>5) Gingrich speaks of mosques having to be under surveillance, because they are the âprimary source of recruitment.â Actually the exact opposite is true. Most ISIS recruits are radicalized online. People with access to mosques and traditional Islamic teachings see through the superficial siren call of ISIS and recognize that attacks on civilians are unwarranted in Islamic law, and against the very teachings of the Prophet Muhammad.</p><p>6) To apply surveillance and deportation is to hold an entire community in the millions accountable for the actions of a handful in other countries, that they have no control over. It would be akin to holding American Christians responsible for actions of Christian militias in Central African Republic. We do not have any power over ISIS. We do have a say about what happens here in America. This is our home, this is the imperfect democratic experiment that we are a part of, and this is the place that we are going to fight every day to make it a âmore perfect unionâ by upholding justiceânot trampling on justice.</p><p>7) The terrorist attack on Nice is vile and repulsive, thought it is not âsenselessâ as many of us would like to think. It actually has a purpose and design. The stated goal of ISIS is to draw a wedge between Muslims and the non-Muslim societies in which we live. To use ISISâ own language, the stated goal of these savage terrorist attacks is to âeliminate the gray zonesâ between Muslims and non-Muslim majoritarian societies. ISIS wants to provoke non-Muslim majority (âWesternâ) societies to turn on its own Muslim citizens, creating a whole generation of alienated, antagonized Muslims who will be displaced and alienated, and in turn to become ISIS potential recruits. In a real sense, and I do not use this casually, Newt Gingrichâs rhetoric lets the terrorists win. We demand, and deserve, better than both ISIS and the hateful rhetoric of the likes of Newt Gingrich.</p><p>Omid Safi<br/>Director, Duke Islamic Studies Center</p></blockquote>",
