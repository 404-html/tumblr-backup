According to military-ranks.org (a website that I have no reason to question):<br/></p>\n<blockquote><p>\n\nBy law, colonels must have <b>twenty-two years of service</b> and a minimum of three years of service as a lieutenant colonel. Most colonels spend three years as a lieutenant colonel before being promoted.\n\n<br/></p></blockquote>\n<p>I think itâs pretty widely established that Carol joined the Air Force as soon as she was 18, which would place her squarely at age 40 after the minimum 22 year service, assuming she got promoted as soon as she was eligible.</p>\n<p>What Iâm getting at here is that, unless the Marvel Cinematic Universe is stripping Carol of her illustrious military history, thereâs no damn reason for her to played by a 26 year old. At all.</p>\n<p>â¦ Unless they think a woman in her forties has no business being a superhero, in which case Iâd like to direct your attention to Jeremy Renner (cast as Hawkeye at 40), Ben Affleck (Batman at 43), Robert Downey Jr. (Iron Man since age 44), and Paul Rudd (debuting as Ant-Man at forty-fucking-six).</p>\n<p>Listen to me. Listen. Women over forty are badasses. Â¾ of the new Ghostbusters cast are women in their 40â²s. Ming-Na Wen is kicking asses and taking names all over Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. at 52. Those old ladies from Mad Max: Fury Road - including Megan Jaffer, whoâs <b>78</b> - <a href=\"http://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.madmaxuniverse.com%2Fthe-old-ladies-of-fury-road-did-their-own-stunts%2F&amp;t=ODM0NDlhMzYxZjgyNTEzZjAwZGE5MGI3YjJiYzVhZTlmNDM2YWRhNixVaHVraDdBRQ%3D%3D\">did their own fucking stunts.Â </a></p>\n<p><b>There Is No Expiration On Women Being Awesome.</b></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>*SCREAMS LOUDLY ABOUT LUCY LAWLESS*</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I see no reason why they couldnât have cast, say, Amy Smart, or Ali Larter.</p>\n</blockquote>",
