Felt dark planet turn under my feet and knew what cats know that makes them scream like babies in night. </p>\n\n<p>Looked at sky through smoke heavy with human fat and God was not there. The cold, suffocating dark goes on forever, and we are alone.</p>\n\n<p>Live our lives, lacking anything better to do. Devise reason later.</p>\n\n<p>Born from oblivion; bear children, hell-bound as ourselves; go into oblivion.</p>\n\n<p>There is nothing else.</p>",
