   "quote-text" : "<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a 10-hour flight, and you only have 12 or 13 hours of fuel on board,&rdquo; Alberta bush pilot Sean Loutitt said. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re monitoring the weather the whole time, but eventually you get to a point of no return. Then you&rsquo;re committed to the pole, no matter what.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>Loutitt was the chief pilot for Kenn Borek during the mission to evacuate Shemenski in 2001. Before that rescue effort, no one had flown to Amundsen-Scott through the polar night. It was assumed that it couldn&rsquo;t be done.</p>\n\n<p>That belief is part of the mythology of the pole, Shemenski said. &ldquo;It was like a macho thing,&rdquo; he recalled. &ldquo;At that point when the last plane left, you were there for six months. That was it.&rdquo;</p>",
