   "quote-text" : "<p>April 1975</p>\n\n<p>In order to suppress my enemies my work will continue to be from one end to the other, a succession of violent, audacious, unfathomable, and subversive wonders that will embrace more mystery, more poetry, more madness, more eroticism, torment, pathos, grandeur, and the cosmology of synthesis because there is no point in bothering to see films that are not sensational!</p>\n\n<p>Thus in accordance with this manifesto of my imaginative autonomy, one could subsequently try to bankrupt systematically the logical meaning of all mechanisms of the rational, practical, and effete form emerging from the &lsquo;new&rsquo; and 'new new&rsquo; Hollywood who are nothing more than snotty apologists of youth, of revolution, undulation, fossilized excrements of preservation and those who support the collective and therefore opposed to the individual!</p>\n\n<p>I await you Hollywood feverishly,</p>\n\n<p>(Signed)</p>\n\n<p>Josef Bogdanovich</p>",
