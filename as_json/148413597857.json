Â Sure, Garnet says this now that sheâs being lusted after by some creepy mailman, but back when Ruby and Sapphire first met all it took was chasing a frog and two minutes of singing for it to be twu wuv foreva. Â And letâs not forget that Greg fell head over heels in love with Rose within five minutes of meeting her.<br/></p>\n<p>But Rose and Greg, in that respect, were redeemed inÂ âWe Need to Talkâ. Â That episode showed clearly that, while Greg and Rose may have become infatuated when they first met, it took real work and a lot of talking before they were able to form a proper relationship. Â âThe Answerâ featured none of that, and a lot of viewers seemed to feel cheated.</p>\n<p>I think thatâs a bit unfair. Â Partly because I think it was pretty clear that the events in âThe Answerâ took place over some time, maybe days, maybe weeks, but considering the lifespan of Gems it could easily have been months or years before Ruby and Sapphire decided to fuse again. Â In addition, after âThe Answerâ, Ruby and Sapphire had five thousand fucking years to get to know each other and build a relationship. Â And most of all, because Ruby and Sapphire did get their own version ofÂ âWe Need to Talkâ, and it was calledÂ âKeystone Motelâ.</p>\n<figure data-orig-width=\"320\" data-orig-height=\"180\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"http://66.media.tumblr.com/c3b1f9099c9d34c9e51fbbb53ffe5765/tumblr_inline_o4gnzmQ2qc1qj8217_500.gif\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"320\" data-orig-height=\"180\"/></figure><p>Okay, right off the bat, this is my favourite episode ofÂ âSteven Universeâ so far, hands down. Â Because Iâve seen some kidsâ media handle similar themes asÂ âWe Need to Talkâ (âBeauty and the Beastâ is a great example); the themes of realising someone isnât who you think they are, and that youâre falling in love with them. Â Sometimes the characters start out infatuated, sometimes they start out hating or fearing each other, but by the end theyâre in love. Â Itâs not an uncommon story. Â But I donât think Iâve seen any such stories touching on what we see inÂ âKeystone Motelâ. Â </p>\n<p>âKeystone Motelâ is exactly what Garnet was talking about in the first two images; itâs about how a relationship takes fucking <i>work</i>. Â <br/></p>\n<figure data-orig-width=\"635\" data-orig-height=\"386\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"http://66.media.tumblr.com/78ecb5abcbfa7217e3070dbc9078931d/tumblr_inline_o4gp09AxGA1qj8217_540.gif\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"635\" data-orig-height=\"386\"/></figure><figure data-orig-width=\"369\" data-orig-height=\"206\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"http://66.media.tumblr.com/5d840264d0e2576029378be64fa68435/tumblr_inline_o4gp16fDkT1qj8217_500.gif\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"369\" data-orig-height=\"206\"/></figure><p>Ruby and Sapphire are an established couple. Â They are committed, devoted, and deeply in love. Â And they are fucking <i>pissed</i>Â at each other. Â Ruby feels that her feelings are being ignored and devalued. Â And Sapphire feels that she must put her own pain aside for the greater good, and canât understand why Ruby canât do the same. Â Neither of them is wrong, but neither of them is right either. Their inability to reconcile these emotions are what leads to Garnet un-fusing. Â So yes, the couple literally has a fight so furious that they separate. Â And they both talk about how infuriating the other can be, and how useless it is to talk to them sometimes. Â </p>\n<p><i>But they work it out.</i></p>\n<figure data-orig-width=\"518\" data-orig-height=\"292\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"http://66.media.tumblr.com/2c2f57e58e14aedd769ad8f0f6467bf4/tumblr_inline_o4gqoij0bK1qj8217_540.gif\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"518\" data-orig-height=\"292\"/></figure><p>They talk. Â Sapphire realises sheâs been ignoring Rubyâs feelings, treating her anger as though it wasnât legitimate. Â Ruby realises that sheâs been letting her rage and pain carry her away. Â They realise that theyâve both made mistakes, are both expressing their feelings of hurt and betrayal in their own way, and that thereâs nothing wrong with that. Â And through it all, despite being angry, and irritated, and in painâ¦they still love each other. Â </p>\n<p>A couple does not have to be sunshine and rainbows and lovey-snuggle-bunnies 24/7. Â You can be angry with someone, hurt by their behaviour, find them annoying as all <i>fuck</i>â¦but still love them. Â And you can still work out your problems, if youâre willing to communicate and put in the effort. Â </p>\n<p>How many times do we see that in any show or movie, let alone one for kids? And how valuable, how powerful is this lesson? Â How important is it to teach that sometimes relationships take work, and sometimes that work comes hand in hand with pain. Â But if you love each other, if you listen, if you respect your partner for who they areâ¦then you can come through it all the stronger. Â </p>\n<p>I fucking love Garnet. Because Garnet represents one of the very, very few examples in popular culture of a healthy relationship. Â And that is so fucking important that I do not have words to express it.</p>\n<figure data-orig-width=\"540\" data-orig-height=\"303\" class=\"tmblr-full\"><img src=\"http://65.media.tumblr.com/3288aba8f04042145e3202cede81b3bd/tumblr_inline_o4gr9p6i6Z1qj8217_540.gif\" alt=\"image\" data-orig-width=\"540\" data-orig-height=\"303\"/></figure></blockquote>\n<p>^ AN IMPORTANT POST RIGHT HERE<br/></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><a class=\"tumblelog\" href=\"https://tmblr.co/mGFHQHXo94L-5YaAvu5prQQ\">@zombiefishgirl</a></p>\n</blockquote>",
