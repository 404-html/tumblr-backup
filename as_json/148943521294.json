We are coming into a new world; a kind new world, where men will rise above their hate, their greed, and brutality. Look up, Hanna! The soul of man has been given wings and at last he is beginning to fly. He is flying into the rainbow. Into the light of hope! Into the future! The glorious future! That belongs to you, to me, and to all of us. Look up, Hanna! Look up!\n</p><div align=\"right\">&ndash; The Jewish Barber, <i>The Great Dictator</i>, written by Charles Chaplin</div>",
