   "regular-body" : "<p>&ldquo;Once upon a time there was a protein named Hansel and another named Gretel. We so wanted to see them together but it never happened. So we took a cage and managed to attract Gretel to it. After great effort we got Red Riding Hood to walk by that way with seven dwarves. Soon there was a huge crowd of kids standing around oggling at the handsome Gretel (<i>handsome</i> Gretel? &ndash; the protein gets totally changed beyond recongition by the time they do anything to it!). In the crowd, happened to pass by Hansel who was feeding cattle. And he fell in love with Snow White (Snow White?! &ndash; well, I told you there were seven dwarves, didn&rsquo;t I?). Therefore we conclude that Hansel and Gretel were always together, and lived happily ever after.&rdquo;\n</p><div align=\"right\">&ndash; Shruti Kapoor, on how molecular biology papers<br/> are a lot like fairy tales</div>",
