   "regular-body" : "<p>Writing is not a science, it&rsquo;s an art.<br/>\nYou can codify writing like Heinlein, Herbert, Dickens and Rand.<br/>\nNo matter how many average writers you put together in a room, you won&rsquo;t end up with the Dune saga.<br/>\nComplexity is the enemy of elegance and power.<br/>\nC, Lisp, python are so popular because they are elegant, simple, and thus powerful.<br/>\nIt&rsquo;s not its complexity that makes a system great, it&rsquo;s its simplicity.<br/>\nLikewise Shakespeare.<br/>\n&gt;Coding is not an art. It&rsquo;s a science. No matter how good the code is, it can be taken apart and understood by others.<br/>\nLikewise Shakespeare, Heinlein, Asimov, etc. Yet still art. Because while you can reduce it to 26 + punctuation, it&rsquo;s the organization in time and space that makes them unique.<br/>\nGreat code just works, and nobody needs to go back and fix it later, because it&rsquo;s never going to be broken.<br/>\nIf it needs to be modified, you say.<br/>\nI reply, why?<br/>\nBecause it no longer performs the needed business function you say.<br/>\nI ask: And that means its broken?<br/>\nYou say: No, it means it needs to do something else.<br/>\nI Reply: You mean, a different function?<br/>\nExactly, you beam.<br/>\nI counter: Follow the Unix Way: Each program does one thing: What you need is another program.<br/>\nYou slouch. You know I am right.<br/>\nZen lesson over.\n</p><div align=\"right\">&ndash; Christopher Mahan, <a href=\"http://developers.slashdot.org/comments.pl?sid=141048&amp;cid=11819657\">on Slashdot</a></div>",
