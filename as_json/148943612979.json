It&rsquo;s like you get homesick for a place that doesn&rsquo;t exist. I mean, it&rsquo;s like this rite of passage, you know. You won&rsquo;t have this feeling again until you create a new idea of home for yourself, you know, for your kids, for the family you start, it&rsquo;s like a cycle or something. I miss the idea of it. Maybe that&rsquo;s all family really is. A group of people who miss the same imaginary place.\n</p><div align=\"right\">&ndash; Andrew Largeman, <i>Garden State</i></div>",
