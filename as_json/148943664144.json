   "regular-body" : "<p>The secret is the other dance. \n</p>\n\n<p>\nIn the village in the Ramtops where they understand what the Morris dance is all about, they dance it just once, at dawn, on the first day of spring. They don&rsquo;t dance it after that, all through the summer. After all, what would be the point? What use would it be? \nBut on a certain day when the nights are drawing in, the dancers leave work early and take, from attics and cupboards, the other costume, the black one, and the other bells. And they go by separate ways to a valley among the leafless trees. They don&rsquo;t speak. There is no music. It&rsquo;s very hard to imagine what kind there could be. \n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe bells don&rsquo;t ring. They&rsquo;re made of octiron, a magic metal. But they&rsquo;re not, precisely, silent bells. Silence is merely the absence of noise. They make the opposite of noise, a sort of heavily textured silence. \n</p>\n\n<p>\nAnd in the cold afternoon, as the light drains from the sky, among the frosty leaves and in the dampair, they dance the other Morris. Because of the balance of things. \n</p>\n\n<p>\nYou&rsquo;ve got to dance both, they say. Otherwise you can&rsquo;t dance either.\n</p>\n\n<div align=\"right\">&ndash; Terry Pratchett, <i>Reaper Man</i></div>",
