   "regular-body" : "<!-- from fortune -->\n\n<p class=\"mobile-post\">We were young and our happiness dazzled us with its strength.  But there \nwas also a terrible betrayal that lay within me like a Merle Haggard song \nat a French restaurant. [&hellip;]\n</p>\n\n<p>\n         I could not tell the girl about the woman of the tollway, of her \nmilk white BMW and her Jordache smile.  There had been a fight.  I had \npunched her boyfriend, who fought the mechanical bulls.  Everyone told \nhim, &ldquo;You ride the bull, senor.  You do not fight it.&rdquo;  But he was lean \nand tough like a bad rib-eye and he fought the bull.  And then he fought \nme.  And when we finished there were no winners, just men doing what men \nmust do. [&hellip;]\n</p>\n<p>\n         &ldquo;Stop the car,&rdquo; the girl said.\n</p>\n<p>\n         There was a look of terrible sadness in her eyes.  She knew about \nthe woman of the tollway.  I knew not how.  I started to speak, but she \nraised an arm and spoke with a quiet and peace I will never forget.\n</p>\n<p>\n         &ldquo;I do not ask for whom&rsquo;s the tollway belle,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;the \ntollway belle&rsquo;s for thee.&rdquo;\n</p><p>\n         The next morning our youth was a memory, and our happiness was a \nlie. Life is like a bad margarita with good tequila, I thought as I poured \nwhiskey onto my granola and faced a new day.\n</p>\n<div align=\"right\">&ndash; Peter Applebome, International Imitation Hemingway\n                    Competition</div>",
