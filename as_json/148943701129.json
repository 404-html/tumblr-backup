Through good and ill fortune alike she has never lost sight of that quest or forgotten the ideals which gave her strength. We end today a period of ill fortune and India discovers herself again. The achievement we celebrate today is but a step, an opening of opportunity, to the greater triumphs and achievements that await us. Are we brave enough and wise enough to grasp this opportunity and accept the challenge of the future?\n</p>\n\n<div align=\"right\">&ndash; Jawaharlal Nehru, speech to the constituent assembly, August 15, 1947</div>\n\n<p><em>Happy Independence Day, India!</em></p>",
