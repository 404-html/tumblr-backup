It is held with \ngreatest tenacity by those accustomed to falling into adversity, and most \nacceptably expounded with the grin that apes a smile.  Being a blind \nfaith, it is inaccessible to the light of disproof &ndash; an intellectual \ndisorder, yielding to no treatment but death.  It is hereditary, but not \ncontagious.</p>\n\n<div align=\"right\">&ndash; Ambrose Bierce</div>",
