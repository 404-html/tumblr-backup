Part of what makes \nAmerica &ldquo;great&rdquo; is, theoretically at least, its reluctance to use force \nagainst other nations. Yet, fearful that standards such as this place us \nat a disadvantage in the real world, some neoconservatives advocate that \nAmerica needs to win a war somewhere, to use violence successfully. \nTheir insecurity would have us violate American values &ndash; to mirror the \nhideous brutality of less open societies &ndash; in order to preserve them.\n</p>\n\n<div align=\"right\">&ndash; Jason DeParle, <a href=\"http://groups.google.com/group/soc.culture.indian/msg/38b451bdbfbefb61?\"><em>Why Gandhi Drives the Neoconservatives Crazy</em></a>, from the Washington Monthly, September 1983</div>",
