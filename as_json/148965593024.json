   "regular-body" : "<p>\n&hellip; Congress recently handed the National Guard\n over to the President &ndash; the Guard was set up specifically under the\n command of state governors, not the president, to spread that military\n power out a bit. But after more than 125 years, that has suddenly\n changed: Public Law 109-364, aka the John Warner Defense Authorization\n Act of 2007 (HR 5122), specifically gives the president the power to\n declare martial law and deploy troops against the citizens of the U.S.\n Why? We were THIS close to losing World War II, and THAT didn&rsquo;t show\n the need for such a change in the law. We were at the brink of nuclear\n war with the Soviets, and THAT didn&rsquo;t show the need for such a change\n in the law. But a pipsqueak terrorist bastard hiding in the deserts of\n Afghanistan DOES justify such a radical consolidation of power away\n from governors, where it was put ON PURPOSE? Why? And where was the\n public debate about the need for such a thing?\n</p>\n\n<div align=\"right\">&ndash; Randy Cassingham, <a href=\"http://thisistrue.com/\">This Is True</a>, Nov 5, 2006</div>",
