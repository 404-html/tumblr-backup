They&rsquo;re made out of meat.&rdquo;\n\n</p><p>&ldquo;Meat?&rdquo;\n\n</p><p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no doubt about it. We picked up several from different parts of the planet, took them aboard our recon vessels, and probed them all the way through. They&rsquo;re completely meat.&rdquo; \n\n</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s impossible. What about the radio signals? The messages to the stars?&rdquo;\n\n</p><p>&ldquo;They use the radio waves to talk, but the signals don&rsquo;t come from them. The signals come from machines.&rdquo;\n\n</p><p>&ldquo;So who made the machines? That&rsquo;s who we want to contact.&rdquo;\n\n</p><p>&ldquo;They made the machines. That&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m trying to tell you. Meat made the machines.&rdquo; \n\n</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s ridiculous. How can meat make a machine? You&rsquo;re asking me to believe in sentient meat.&rdquo;\n\n</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not asking you, I&rsquo;m telling you. These creatures are the only sentient race in that sector and they&rsquo;re made out of meat.&rdquo;\n\n</p><p>&ldquo;Maybe they&rsquo;re like the orfolei. You know, a carbon-based intelligence that goes through a meat stage.&rdquo;\n\n</p><p>&ldquo;Nope. They&rsquo;re born meat and they die meat. We studied them for several of their life spans, which didn&rsquo;t take long. Do you have any idea what&rsquo;s the life span of meat?&rdquo;\n\n</p><p>&ldquo;Spare me. Okay, maybe they&rsquo;re only part meat. You know, like the weddilei. A meat head with an electron plasma brain inside.&rdquo;\n\n</p><p>&ldquo;Nope. We thought of that, since they do have meat heads, like the weddilei. But I told you, we probed them. They&rsquo;re meat all the way through.&rdquo;\n\n</p><p>&ldquo;No brain?&rdquo;\n\n</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, there&rsquo;s a brain all right. It&rsquo;s just that the brain is made out of meat! That&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;ve been trying to tell you.&rdquo;\n\n</p><div align=\"right\">&ndash; Terry Bisson, <em><a href=\"http://www.terrybisson.com/meat.html\">They&rsquo;re made out of meat</a></em></div>",
