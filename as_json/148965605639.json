I remember my extreme rage, shared by many, at this and vowen not to upgrade. Then after a month or so I got a critical contract application form in word 6. I could not read it in word 5 and had to buy word 6. so yes to your question.\n</p>\n\n<div align=\"right\">&ndash; goombah99, <a href=\"http://it.slashdot.org/comments.pl?sid=216934&amp;cid=17614866\">on Slashdot</a></div>",
