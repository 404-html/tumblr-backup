We can see that it is being torn asunder even now, as the weight of its users grows apace and the number of users exceeds 300k, 400k , 500k where will it stop? Also, there is a migration of the most intelligent users away to kuro5hin, which is a much more innovative weblog than /., and is a community rather than a mob.</p>\n\n<p>\nUltimately, I don&rsquo;t think Slashdot will exist in 5 years time for technological reasons. Eventually everyone will have huge bandwidth and something else will spring up to take /.&rsquo;s place. I consider Slashdot to be a hiatus between Usenet and the next big thing.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nRegarding Karma, I agree. It really doesn&rsquo;t matter a hoot, and &lsquo;Karma Whores&rsquo; appear to be a thing of the past with the advent of the Karma Cap. However, it really would be better for /. if Karma were invisisble to the user, that way the pointless competitive aspect would not occur.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nI just wish the people that harass me would get the message and go away. They really are annoying, and appear to have the wrong end of the stick.\n</p>\n\n<div align=\"right\">&ndash; &ldquo;Heidi Wall&rdquo;, <em><a href=\"http://interviews.slashdot.org/comments.pl?sid=10724&amp;cid=407492\">Slashdot in 5-10 years?</a></em>, in February, 2001</div>",
