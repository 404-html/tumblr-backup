We need to be the change we would like to see in the world.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nWe are a piece of the greater puzzle of this world. We share it with other peoples, and other nations, with hopes and aspirations of their own. The Muslim today, as a pan-ethnic, pan-national identity, has much to be proud of. Our contributions to the world are many and lasting. We are intrinsically and inextricably part of the family of humanity, and though people like Mr. Wilders and others like him seek to dehumanize us as âthe other,â belittle our grievances, and seek to exclude us from pursuing happiness like everyone else, we should know better.\n</p>\n\n<div align=\"right\">&ndash; Iftekharul Haque, <a href=\"http://iftekhar.blogspot.com/2009/02/geert-wilders-fitna-much-ado-about.html\"><em>Geert Wilders&rsquo; Fitna: Much Ado About Nothing</em></a></div>",
