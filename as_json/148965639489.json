   "regular-body" : "<p>\n&ldquo;My life is very monotonous,&rdquo; the fox said. &ldquo;I hunt chickens; men hunt me. All the chickens are just alike, and all the men are just alike. And, in consequence, I am a little bored. But if you tame me, it will be as if the sun came to shine on my life. I shall know the sound of a step that will be different from all the others. Other steps send me hurrying back underneath the ground. Yours will call me, like music, out of my burrow. And then look: you see the grain-fields down yonder? I do not eat bread. Wheat is of no use to me. The wheat fields have nothing to say to me. And that is sad. But you have hair that is the color of gold. Think how wonderful that will be when you have tamed me! The grain, which is also golden, will bring me back the thought of you. And I shall love to listen to the wind in the wheat &hellip;&rdquo;\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe fox gazed at the little prince, for a long time.\n</p>\n\n<div align=\"right\">&ndash; Antoine de Saint-ExupÃ©ry, <em>The Little Prince</em></div>\n\n<p>(First collected ages ago on Malabar Hill, Bombay)</p>",
