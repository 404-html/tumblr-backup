I mean, wouldnât you think so? but the vet said that the dog was eating, and pooping, and happy, so there was no reason to put him down, so they didnât</p>\n<p>but thatâs not even the weird part. the weird part is the area of the brain that got caved in on was apparently the area that registers pain, so this one-eared, collapsed skull dog could no longer feel <i>any</i>Â pain. he got old, his joints got stiff, his teeth rotted out of his head, his tongue hung out of his mouth and got black and hard, and he felt none of it! in fact, he was happier than heâd ever been feeling no pain, and the fact that he didnât feel how much he was falling apart somehow made him live until he was <i><b>23</b></i>. thatâs right, the collapsed skull, one eared, zero teeth, smells like literal death when alone dog lived to be <b><i>23</i>Â </b>years old. they used to joke that heâd been dead for years, but was too stupid to realize it yet</p>\n<p>and thatâs the story about the <i>literal zombie dog</i> my friendâs family owned</p>\n</blockquote>",
