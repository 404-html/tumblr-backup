   "quote-text" : "They say that âConfronting triggers, not avoiding them, is the best way to overcome PTSDâ. They point out that âexposure therapyâ is the best treatment for trauma survivors, including rape victims. And that this involves reliving the trauma and exposing yourself to traumatic stimuli, exactly what trigger warnings are intended to prevent. All this is true. But I feel like they are missing a very important point.<br/>\nYOU DO NOT GIVE PSYCHOTHERAPY TO PEOPLE WITHOUT THEIR CONSENT.<br/>\nPsychotherapists treat arachnophobia with exposure therapy, too. They expose people first to cute, little spiders behind a glass cage. Then bigger spiders. Then they take them out of the cage. Finally, in a carefully controlled environment with their very supportive therapist standing by, they make people experience their worst fear, like having a big tarantula crawl all over them. It usually works pretty well.<br/>\nFinding an arachnophobic person, and throwing a bucket full of tarantulas at them while shouting âIâM HELPING! IâM HELPING!â works less well.<br/>\nAnd this seems to be the arachnophobeâs equivalent of the PTSD âadviceâ in the Pacific Standard. There are two problems with its approach. The first is that it avoids the carefully controlled, anxiety-minimizing setup of psychotherapy.<br/>\nThe second is that YOU DO NOT GIVE PSYCHOTHERAPY TO PEOPLE WITHOUT THEIR CONSENT.",
