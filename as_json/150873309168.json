The result? Agrabah is virtually crime-free (if not for Aladdin), has a thriving economy, and is populated by happy, non-oppressed people. Jafar has turned it into one of the cleanest, most peaceful, most successful ancient civilizations ever portrayed.</p><p>And yet, Jafar is branded the bad guy when he understandably tries to stop the three greatest threats to Agrabahâs freedom and security: 1) the Sultan, a bumbling idiot dictator who changes laws on a whim, 2) Aladdin, <a href=\"http://www.cracked.com/video_20074_why-everyone-in-aladdin-awful.html\">a dangerous thief/conman</a> who is easily able to manipulate the Sultan, and 3) Jasmine, the spoiled, insubordinate princess so fed up with <i>being rich</i> that she runs away from home, at which point she thoughtlessly <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6nqfYQLp0Q\">steals food from a merchant</a>. Sheâs so out of touch with reality, itâs literally criminal.</p><p>\n\nJafarâs hypnotic staff and quest for the lamp are merely a contingency to ensure his benevolent reign. Even his song was the best. Long may he rule.\n\n<br/></p><h2><b><a href=\"http://www.cracked.com/article_24182_5-movie-villains-who-were-completely-right-whole-time.html\">\n\n5 Movie Villains Who Were Completely Right The Whole Time\n\n</a></b></h2></blockquote>",
