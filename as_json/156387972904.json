   "quote-text" : "I&rsquo;m a heterosexual. And I-I don&rsquo;t know why I just said that, except that as of this morning I&rsquo;m the most famous &ndash; not famous, but apparently the most powerful lesbian on the planet. When the fact of the matter is I&rsquo;m crazy, absolutely crazy, about this particular man I just met and had two fabulous dinners with in the space of one week, a man who hasn&rsquo;t had the courtesy to call me today, probably because he&rsquo;s simply of the undependable gender or, come to think of it, maybe he has even less of an idea about how to deal with my alleged and fictitious lesbianism than I do. So, he&rsquo;ll just &hellip; remain silent, like a submarine under the ice cap, and drift away &hellip; just drift away like the legion of other cowards, who I spent my young life staring at the phone, panting like an exquisite collie hoping for table scraps. Until I became successful and suddenly started to scare them, scare them with the very independence they required me to have, so that now, I&rsquo;m looking at some bad numbers, really rough stuff, if you know what I&rsquo;m talking about &ndash; but what was I supposed to do, turn down an opportunity to serve the President of the United States who I believe in and adore? You just want to share it all with someone, you know?",
