   "quote-text" : "In 1962, the Drug Efficacy Amendment to the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act passed in a single day â the fastest modern passage of a bill outside a declaration of war. Thus was born the FDA-required double blind, placebo-controlled trial. Possibly the most expensive and difficult pieces of red tape to clear in all of government. A simple requirement that drugs outperform a placebo. Itâs not known exactly how many drugs fall victim to the Kefauverâs little rule (drug companies donât exactly announce their failures) but in 2011, only five pain therapies resulted from the 2,000 or so registered trials. With a single drug costing as much as $2 billion to develop, itâs a very expensive speed bump.\n<br/><br/>\nBut hereâs the interesting part â and the one that we must keep in mind today. After the bill passed, there arose an interesting problem: what to do with all the drugs already in use that had never been tested against a placebo? In 1963 the FDA created the Drug Efficacy Study Implementation (or DESI). Essentially, for the next 20 years, scientists would go through all our old drugs and make sure â¦ well â¦ that they worked. Technically, DESI is still in effect today (since, amazingly, a few of the drugs still havenât been, and probably never will be, checked) but most of its drug-killing work is done. And when the smoke cleared on the battlefield, more than 1,000 drugs lay dying in the field. One thousand drugs that the market had deemed effective but that were actually no better than a placebo. And this was back when there werenât nearly as many drugs on the market in the first place.\n<br/><br/>\nThe masses are good at many things. Finding planets, for instance. Or driving the worldâs car markets to ever-better quality and efficiency. Or proofreading Taylor Swiftâs Wikipedia page. But when more than half of us canât pass the E. Morton Jellinek test, we are not great at picking effective drugs. Itâs not that weâre stupid or that the drug companies arenât good at their jobs. Itâs that itâs incredibly hard for many (especially chronic) conditions to separate what works and what doesnât. Itâs why we spent centuries using spider webs and pigeon feces as medicine. Itâs why billions of people rely on things like homeopathy or traditional Chinese medicine. We wouldnât crowd source the best way to do brain surgery, so why would we assume the market knows how to pick a good drug? So when people talk about streamlining drug development or removing red tape or engaging the end user, we must remember weâve been down this road before.",
