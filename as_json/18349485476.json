   "quote-text" : "FOR the peccaries at the Jerusalem Biblical Zoo, it is a familiar experience. Dark-clothed humans appear disgusted when they spot them from afar, and then, drawing nearer, suddenly beam smiles and benevolence. The pig-like animals from South America have a comforting sign on their enclosure. âDoss is nisht a chazer,â it assures Yiddish-speaking visitors from the cityâs ultra-Orthodox Jewish community: âThis is not a pig.â"
