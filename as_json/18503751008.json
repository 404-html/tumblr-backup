   "quote-text" : "<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeremy_Hardy\">Jeremy</a> has been performing unprofessionally for 24 years. He was the youngest of five children and his mother would rather have had a holiday, so dressed him as a caravan for the first six years of his life. He could kill a man with his bare hands if he had bare hands but he doesn&rsquo;t, he has human hands (<em>this gag still doesn&rsquo;t work in print &ndash; Ed</em>). Jeremy travels <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom\">the country</a> performing his one-man show, hoping some day to increase the size of his audience to two or even three. He prefers not to publicise his charity work because he doesn&rsquo;t do any, although he does spend time visiting the elderly, reminding them <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I%27m_Sorry_I_Haven%27t_a_Clue#2007\">they&rsquo;ve got a show to do</a>.",
