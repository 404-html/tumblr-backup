   "regular-body" : "I really like <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endgame_(TV_series)\"><em>Endgame</em></a>, I do. But the mysteries just aren&rsquo;t fun enough. And I think <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1818731/\">I&rsquo;ve finally hit one</a> that I&rsquo;ve completely figured out 30 minutes in. Don&rsquo;t send me back to L&amp;O:SVU, please.\n\n<p><b>Update, 10 minutes later</b>: Dear Endgame, all is forgiven! You might have predictable mystery solutions, but you play it out well, and you do have a great sense of humour.</p>\n\n<p><b>Update, mere seconds after last update</b>: And then they play it off with an <em>The Importance of Being Ernest</em> reference. All is right with the world.\n</p>",
