Mention that a person is tall and he&rsquo;ll quickly add, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m tall!&rdquo; If he hears the word &ldquo;Legos,&rdquo; barely a second passes before he says, &ldquo;Legos. I love Legos.&rdquo; Saying &ldquo;I&rsquo;m gay&rdquo; is his way of telling people: this is something I like about myself.",
