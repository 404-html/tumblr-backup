   "quote-text" : "Since that day, any time the word &#8220;gay&#8221; has come into conversation, [my seven year old son] has happily announced to those around him, &#8220;I&#8217;m gay!&#8221; He says this very naturally and happily, the same way he announces other things that he likes about himself. Mention that a person is tall and he&#8217;ll quickly add, &#8220;I&#8217;m tall!&#8221; If he hears the word &#8220;Legos,&#8221; barely a second passes before he says, &#8220;Legos. I love Legos.&#8221; Saying &#8220;I&#8217;m gay&#8221; is his way of telling people: this is something I like about myself.",
