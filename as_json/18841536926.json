   "quote-text" : "Since that day, any time the word &ldquo;gay&rdquo; has come into conversation, [my seven year old son] has happily announced to those around him, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m gay!&rdquo; He says this very naturally and happily, the same way he announces other things that he likes about himself. Mention that a person is tall and he&rsquo;ll quickly add, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m tall!&rdquo; If he hears the word &ldquo;Legos,&rdquo; barely a second passes before he says, &ldquo;Legos. I love Legos.&rdquo; Saying &ldquo;I&rsquo;m gay&rdquo; is his way of telling people: this is something I like about myself.",
