   "quote-text" : "I work at the comedy website CollegeHumor.com, where I am one of two staffed female writers within a writing team of 16 (boom â recognize that ratio, motherfuckers?). I am often asked why we donât have more female writers. The answer is, again, depressingly simple: we are completely underwhelmed by the number of female applicants. Like any content publisher, we look for the best writers, period, regardless of gender. Our intern application ratio of guys to girls is 6:1.",
