   "quote-text" : "<p>Another telling incident occurs when Billy returns home from elementary school, where he is unpopular and alienated, to a home where he receives little affirmation and approval. He passionately hugs Woofers, mistakenly believing that the dog is sad and lonely without him.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;You just need some love,&rdquo; says Billy, offering Woofers a treat as he gazes at the dog&rsquo;s blank, uncomprehending face. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re by yourself all day long, and you must&rsquo;ve really missed me, huh, Woofers? Isn&rsquo;t that right? Yes, it is. Yes, it is.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>When Woofers responds enthusiastically, jumping up and down in response to the attention and food he receives during this daily greeting ritual, Billy erroneously interprets this as a sign of the dog&rsquo;s agreement with what he is saying.</p>",
