   "quote-text" : "<p>Another telling incident occurs when Billy returns home from elementary school, where he is unpopular and alienated, to a home where he receives little affirmation and approval. He passionately hugs Woofers, mistakenly believing that the dog is sad and lonely without him.</p>\n\n<p>\"You just need some love,\" says Billy, offering Woofers a treat as he gazes at the dog&#8217;s blank, uncomprehending face. \"You&#8217;re by yourself all day long, and you must&#8217;ve really missed me, huh, Woofers? Isn&#8217;t that right? Yes, it is. Yes, it is.\"</p>\n\n<p>When Woofers responds enthusiastically, jumping up and down in response to the attention and food he receives during this daily greeting ritual, Billy erroneously interprets this as a sign of the dog&#8217;s agreement with what he is saying.</p>",
