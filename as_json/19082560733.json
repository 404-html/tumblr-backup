   "photo-caption" : "<p>I played a bit of <a href=\"http://www.bay12games.com/dwarves/\">Dwarf Fortress</a> yesterday. I tell a lie: once you wrap your mind about it, DF is one of those games you start playing for an hour or so, and then &#8212; bam! &#8212; four a.m. It&#8217;s as much fun as I remember, I <em>finally</em> managed to get one of the alternate tilesets to work (<a href=\"http://www.bay12forums.com/smf/index.php?topic=53180.0\">this one</a>), so it looks a whole lot prettier and easier to understand. And the dwarves are as mental as ever. My fortress is currently at around 20 dwarves, tottering on the edge of a food crisis (as near as I can tell: no fish, no animals, no nothing. My vegetarian dwarves are unhappy). A newly arrived caravan should keep things going for a while, but I need to read up on farming and <em>fast</em>.</p>\n\n<p>If you are at all interested in a game that&#8217;s sort of SimCity meets Close Combat meets very unhappy dwarves, you should start with the epic story of <em><a href=\"http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Boatmurdered\">Boatmurdered</a></em>, the epic story of one Dwarf Fortress game that spiraled horribly out of control. A good place to start the story is at <a href=\"http://lparchive.org/Dwarf-Fortress-Boatmurdered/Update%201-2/\"><em>Update 1</em></a>.</p>\n\n<p>(More coherent information about <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dwarf_Fortress\">Dwarf Fortress</a>  is available on the usual wiki).</p>",
