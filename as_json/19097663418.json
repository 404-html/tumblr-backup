   "quote-text" : "<p>Your correspondent views Facebook as a necessary evil. It is the only effortless way to stay in touch with acquaintances stretching across many years, cities and companies. Sure, he appreciates Facebook&rsquo;s physical infrastructure and technical expertise. But he prefers to pour his heart and soul into the more ephemeral and chatty Twitter where, to his surprise, he continues to make new friends. (In the last two weeks, Babbage has met in person another dozen people he previously knew solely through Twitter, or reconnected from long ago through the network. As he first discovered a year ago, they have turned out to be just what they seemed. Whether they had the same impression of him is another matter.)</p>\n\n<p>[..]</p>\n\n<p><strong>Facebook, Twitter and the like allow the kind of unimportant banter that binds old friends together, and sometimes helps you make new ones.</strong></p>"
