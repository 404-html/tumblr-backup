   "quote-text" : "As Alice Twemlow notes in her essay about the covers, Lolita is an &#8220;embarrassment of riches&#8221;: complex, stylistically brilliant, structurally perfect, with an insidiously charming, delusional, psychopathic narrator and a dreadfully cruel and terribly bleak plot (&#8220;a threnody for the destruction of a childâs life,&#8221; as Ellen Pifer puts it) that also manages somehow to be deeply amusing. For obvious reasons, of course, it remains as controversial a novel as it was a half century ago, if not more so. And, probably helped along by Kubrickâs breezy film, and many very terrible covers, the term &#8220;Lolita&#8221; has come to popularly mean something quite the opposite of the novelâs namesake, so a designer has that to contend with as well. On the one hand, then, designers face the very real challenge of communicating some of that complexity in a cover, which can easily become overwhelming. (When John Gall weighed in on the competition, he was quick to say that he &#8220;wouldnât give this as an assignment in a million years&#8221; to his cover design class.)",
