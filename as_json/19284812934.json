   "regular-body" : "<p>Today was surprisingly filled with Beatles references, including:\n\n</p><ol><li>A friend quoting <em>Strawberry Fields Forever</em> on Facebook.</li>\n<li>A friend listening to <em>Rubber Soul</em>.</li>\n<li>A friend mentioning that <em>Eleanor Rigby</em> was under-rated.</li>\n</ol>\n\nAnd my personal favourite: a friend in class hit a key on his laptop by mistake and started the very distinctive riff to an early (i.e. pre-<em>Revolver</em>) Beatles song. If only I could remember which one. Any Beatles references you&rsquo;d like to make to start Wednesday off right?",
