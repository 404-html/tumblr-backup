   "quote-text" : "Any cat video posted to YouTube faces stiff competition. Currently there are about 2.3 million cat videos on the site; according to a Google rep I spoke with, that&rsquo;s between eight and nine years&rsquo; worth of cat videos. Of course the field was not always so crowded. The first cat video to go viral was posted in 2006. Called simply &ldquo;<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7bcV-TL9mho\">Puppy vs. Cat</a>&rdquo; (solid SEO!), this historic footage captures a cat confronting an entire litter of puppies. &ldquo;Confronting&rdquo; in this case is perhaps too generous a word, since nothing happens in the video. The puppies are adorable, and the cat is wary of them. The nonevent has attracted almost 13 million views. That&rsquo;s as many viewers as for a typical episode of Two and a Half Men, a show for which 30-second commercials bring in a quarter-million bucks.",
