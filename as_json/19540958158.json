   "quote-text" : "<p>In fourth grade, Wyatt started using &#8220;Nicole&#8221; as a name, and many classmates were calling him &#8220;Nikki&#8221;. The next year, the family went to court and had the name legally changed to Nicole.</p>\n\n<p>To Kelly, it seemed the next logical step. Family discussions merely centered around what the name would be. In the end, Nicole chose it. &#8220;I believed in Nicole&#8221;, her mother says. âShe always knew who she was&#8221;.</p>\n\n<p>Wayne was nervous. Could he call his son Nicole? As usual, he relied on his wife&#8217;s instincts. &#8220;I have to tell you, Kelly&#8217;s the leader in our family&#8221;, he says. &#8220;Both she and Nicole are extremely strong-willed, and I went with the flow.&#8221;</p>\n\n<p>At first, though, he couldn&#8217;t bring himself to use the new name. An Air Force veteran and former Republican, he realizes now he was grieving the loss of a son. &#8220;But once you get past that, I realize I never had a son&#8221;, he says.</p>",
