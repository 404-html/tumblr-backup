Wish there was some time for R&amp;R &ndash; I know there <em>will</em> be once my current project is finished with, hopefully soon, so hooray for that. It hasn&rsquo;t been that depressing a week or anything, just emotionally draining, with very little sleep to process any of the emotional turmoil. But the nice thing about collapsing possibilities is that you get more time to focus on the stuff that&rsquo;s left &ndash; the stuff that&rsquo;s real. Which, after a bit of madness re: my current project and a lot of sleep, I hope will be exactly what I will focus on. So there is that.</p>",
