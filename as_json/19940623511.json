After Erjie told me that you&#8217;d gotten up to give her a wet little nose-nudge the night she came home from the airport, somehow I felt like it wasn&#8217;t time yet. That you&#8217;ve got a couple of laps left to run, a couple of days left to chill out with the people you&#8217;ve known all your life since you were a tiny, wriggling pup, that you&#8217;ve still got a few more nose-nudges left in you yet. Ma says you&#8217;re such a stubborn old chap that you still act like you can do all these things you can&#8217;t, like walk, and they end up having to carry you back into the house. You&#8217;re such a stubborn old chap that I want to let you fight on for a bit, and leave only when you&#8217;re ready to give up. You silly, stubborn old chap, we&#8217;re all probably going to give in long before you give up, and let you go to a better place rather than have you get any worse.",
