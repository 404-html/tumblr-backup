   "quote-text" : "I don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s just me that&rsquo;s not ready to let you die, or if I&rsquo;m right in thinking you&rsquo;re not completely ready to leave yet. After Erjie told me that you&rsquo;d gotten up to give her a wet little nose-nudge the night she came home from the airport, somehow I felt like it wasn&rsquo;t time yet. That you&rsquo;ve got a couple of laps left to run, a couple of days left to chill out with the people you&rsquo;ve known all your life since you were a tiny, wriggling pup, that you&rsquo;ve still got a few more nose-nudges left in you yet. Ma says you&rsquo;re such a stubborn old chap that you still act like you can do all these things you can&rsquo;t, like walk, and they end up having to carry you back into the house. You&rsquo;re such a stubborn old chap that I want to let you fight on for a bit, and leave only when you&rsquo;re ready to give up. You silly, stubborn old chap, we&rsquo;re all probably going to give in long before you give up, and let you go to a better place rather than have you get any worse.",
