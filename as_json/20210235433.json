   "quote-text" : "A common experience of tenement living and other similar style housing in New York City (and other cities) during the manufacturing boom of the late 19th and early 20th century. Apartments were built similar in design with one&rsquo;s bedroom under another&rsquo;s. Thus, it was normal to hear a neighbor removing shoes and hearing them hit the floor above.
