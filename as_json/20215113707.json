Â Well in this book, <strong>Biffâs that guy</strong>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>âHi, Biff, howâs it going?â young George McFly asked, trying to sound casual but not carrying it off very well. Â His voice had a distinctly subservient tone.</p>\n<p>âWhat dâyou mean, it?â Biff shot back as his cohorts laughed. Â âWhatâs <em>it?</em>â</p>\n<p>âErâ¦ thatâs just an expression,â George muttered. Â âIâ¦ just wanted to make sure everything was all right with you.â</p>\n<p>âEverything?â Biff repeated. Â âYouâre interested in <em>everything</em> about me? Â Thatâs a lot. Â You mean, youâre interested in what I had for breakfast, whether I burped afterward or not -â</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>It goes on. Â This sort of fake cleverness has ALWAYS been annoying to me (and itâs always the same tired expressions that are exploited, OR, failing that, itâs always the same stupid artificial prepositional attachment ambiguity) (<em>bitches</em>), so Iâm not sad to see they cut the whole thing entirely. Â Eventually Biff asks for his homework and George doesnât have it and YES THIS SCENE FROM THE MOVIE IS IN THE BOOK phew Iâm glad letâs watch it again:</p>\n<p><img alt=\"IS THERE ANYONE WILLING TO ANSWER THE DOOR, MCFLY??\" height=\"310\" src=\"http://i.imgur.com/EqRKQ.gif\" width=\"500\"/>Â </p>\n<p>The book describes Biffâs friends laughter as âemulating Pavlovâs dog perfectlyâ (ever read writing so clunky it makes you actually wince? Â <em>NOW YOU HAVE</em>.) Â And as Marty watches he sighs and shakes his head and thinks â<strong>It was almost too painful to watch, this beginning of a thirty-year torture test which his father continued to fail</strong>â and so apparently this is the very first time Biff ever bullied George? Â I guess? Â You guys it feels kinda weird to care about how a book is written when the author clearly didnât??</p>\n<p>ANYWAY GET READY FOR MOOD WHIPLASH BECAUSE AT THIS POINT BIFF NOTICES MARTY AND SAYS â<strong>WHAT ARE YOU LOOKING AT, BUTTHEAD?</strong>â AND YES ITâS SO GOOD!! Â Iâd been told this was an on-the-set improvisation but NOPE, Biff called Marty a butthead and I couldnât be happier! Â Tallies: UPDATED.</p>\n<p><strong>BUTTHEAD COUNT: 1Â </strong></p>\n<p><strong>DOC! COUNT: 2</strong> Â (UNCHANGED, BUT STILL HIGHER THAN IN THE VAST MAJORITY OF MOVIES/BOOKS PRODUCED BY HUMANITY)</p>\n<p>Anyway Book Biff calls him a butthead and then leaves it at that, which means we donât get this scene (we also donât get it because Book Martyâs all about the green shoes instead of the sweet puffy vests):</p>\n<p><img height=\"271\" src=\"http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_ltak557BCG1qgmge6o1_500.png\" width=\"500\"/></p>\n<p><img height=\"271\" src=\"http://26.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_ltak557BCG1qgmge6o2_500.png\" width=\"500\"/>Â </p>\n<p>I like this in the movie because George joins in with the laughter in this quiet, sad, desperate way and itâs a great moment that helps describe the character to us really quickly. Â Instead we jump right to where George promises to run the homework over first thing tomorrow morning and Biff does the âHey McFly, your shoeâs untiedâ thing, only it continues afterwards with this frankly baffling passage:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>âFell for it again, didnât you, McFly?â Biff laughed. Â â<strong>Boy, if anyone wanted to coldcock you, they wouldnât have any trouble.</strong>â</p>\n<p>âI guess not,â George murmured.Â </p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>â¦Okay? Â So um to help out our mutual confusion / unfamiliarity with old man slang, I looked up <a href=\"http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=coldcock\">âcoldcockâ on Urban Dictionary</a> and it can mean one of two things:</p>\n<ol><li>âTo beat up a male, and totally knock him out.â</li>\n<li>âThe act of building a giant snow penis in the front of a home unbeknownst to the home owner. This act can be done to the homes of friends, enemies, or strangers alike. Nothing Says âHello Neighbor!â like a frigid mandick saluting strong in the front of oneâs dwelling! For added effect one can bore a hole down the length of the middle of the penis and run a garden hose to it. When the water is turned on the coldcock achieves full salute!â</li>\n</ol><p>I donât think thereâs anything else I could possibly add here</p></blockquote>\n\n<p>Ryan North <em>on fire</em>.</p>"
