   "quote-text" : "The reality is that modern humanity and human civilization are the fruit of a very tightly banded set of interconnected climate and biological conditions. <strong>We need a certain kind of world in order to thrive, and that world is essentially the mild, moderately wet, biologically abundant world of the Holocene.</strong> We&#8217;ve never left that world, and in fact we are still intimately dependent on its plenty for our very survival. We donât know of another set of conditions that would allow us to thrive on this planet. There is no human-designed set of planetary conditions that we know of that will suit us better. We don&#8217;t want the Holocene to end: the whole point is that we want to go back to lower greenhouse gas concentrations in order to continue the Holocene climate indefinitely, as long as we possibly can.",
