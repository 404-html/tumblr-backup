   "quote-text" : "<p>Newt Gingrich does not eat sandwiches; he fundamentally transforms them, radically changing them from solid foodstuff to masticated bolus to energy.</p>\n\n<p>[..]</p>\n\n<p>Just what he has been trying to do was never quite clear. At times it has seemed like he was trying to get elected president. His name has appeared on ballotsânot all of them, of course, but on most.</p>\n\n<p>[..]</p>\n\n<p>Michelle Cottle describes him as being &ldquo;drunk on a cocktail of spite, narcissism and general mischief&rdquo;, which is generally true, though it ignores the profound personal hatred he seems to bear for Mitt Romney. But now even that goal is receding. On Tuesday he sacked his campaign manager and one-third of his staff, saying he will focus on &ldquo;winning a big-choice convention this August.&rdquo; In other words, Screw you, voters! You made the wrong choice, but that&rsquo;s okay: Leader Gingrich will graciously offer your superiors a chance to correct your errors at the convention.</p>",
