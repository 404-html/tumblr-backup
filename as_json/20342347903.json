Has she gone on a shooting rampage because she just canât take the harassment any more?!</i></p>\n\n<p>No. Lionel enters the room, and there is the girl, a glazed over look in her eyes and a clay model of his head on a plinth, eerily reminiscent of Victorian death masks.</p>\n\n<p>Here it is, along with Benjamin Disraeli&rsquo;s for good measure.</p>",
