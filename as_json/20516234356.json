   "quote-text" : "<p>As <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luc_Montagnier#History_of_the_discovery_of_HIV\">the imbroglio</a> grew more bitter, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don_Francis\">[Don] Francis</a> noticed that good virologists were shying away from <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AIDS\">AIDS</a> research, reluctant to become stuck in what had become a quagmire of scientific politicking. AIDS research had become &ldquo;wretched, rank with politics&rdquo;, Francis wrote in his journal that summer. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s lost all the fun and excitement of science&rdquo;.</p>\n\n<p>The intrigue played against the usual backdrop of funding shortages. By the summer of 1984, of course, Francis&rsquo;s lab technicians were working with large quantities of deadly <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HIV\">LAV [= HIV]</a> as well as large amounts of tissue from AIDS patients. His antiquated laboratories, however, did not have an <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autoclave\">autoclave</a> to sterilize pans and instruments. Instead, <strong>technicians carried their contaminated trays and instruments down a hallway to another lab for cleaning</strong>. Doing this required the workers to precariously balance their materials in one hand while they turned the doorknob with their contaminated lab gloves. In the summer of 1984, Francis&rsquo;s problems with doorknobs came to summarize his despair over adequate resources.</p>\n\n<p>[..]</p>\n\n<p>Francis wrote out his request [for European-style door hooks that hospitals use instead of knobs], but nothing happened. He wrote more memos and discussed his safety concerns at every staff meeting, but nothing happened. Altogether, Francis agitated for four months before he was able to negotiate two $2.75 hooks for his lab doors.</p>",
