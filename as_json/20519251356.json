I was just working on --\r\nBuffy: -- your pick up lines?\r\nGiles: Um, in a manner of speaking, yes.\r\nBuffy: Then if you wouldn't mind a little Gene and Roger, you might want to leave off the \"idiot\" part. Being called an idiot tends to take people out of the dating mood.\r\nXander: Hmm. It actually kinda turns me on.\r\nBuffy: I fear you.\r\nBuffy: [to Giles] You might also want to avoid words like \"amenable\" and \"indecorous\", you know.
