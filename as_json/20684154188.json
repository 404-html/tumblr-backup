   "quote-text" : "<p>Short answer: if you are smart enough to get into grad school, you probably have all the talent required to be successful in science. </p>\n\n<p>Supplement to short answer: if you were objectively accepted into grad school, but think you might be the exception who isn&#8217;t talented enough, you may have <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impostor_syndrome\">imposter syndrome</a>, which is very very common, and straightforward enough to deal with.</p>\n\n<p>Long answer: I have been closely watching grad students for 12 years now, and I have formed some opinions on what predicts success. I&#8217;ve thought about it a lot, and I think the single biggest factor is persistence.</p>"
