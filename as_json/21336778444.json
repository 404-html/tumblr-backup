Even when something important happens to you, even when your heartâs getting crushed or exalted, even when youâre absorbed in building the foundations of a personality, there comes these moments when youâre aware that whatâs happening is not the real story. Unless you actually die, the real story is still ahead of you. This alone, this cruel mixture of consciousness and irrelevance, this built-in hollowness, is enough to account for how pissed off you are.â<br/><span>â </span><span>Jonathan Franzen</span><span>, </span><em>The Discomfort Zone</em></p></blockquote>\n\n<p>Adolescence is hilarious, except when you&rsquo;re in it. But it can also be wonderfully wonderful in many ways.</p>",
