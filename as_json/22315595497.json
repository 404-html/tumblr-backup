   "quote-text" : "Perhaps the most remarkable thing about this incident was how an experienced air crew made a rookie mistake. The captain had over 13,000 hours of flying time; the first officer had over 4,000. Yet both nearly forgot that it&rsquo;s a lot easier to land a 220-passenger aircraft when you use the wheels. The Atlantic&rsquo;s James Fallows, a pilot himself, <a href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2012/04/the-jetstar-texting-while-landing-incident-and-the-cessna-descent-into-the-gulf/256134/\">writes</a> that he flies a plane that has non-retractable landing gear for exactly this reason. &ldquo;As the old chestnut has it,&rdquo; Mr Fallows recalls, &ldquo;there are two kinds of retractable-gear pilots: Those who have forgotten to put the gear down, and those who will.&rdquo; There&rsquo;s no getting around pilots&rsquo; humanity; eventually, almost everyone will make a mistake. That&rsquo;s why having a co-pilot and electronic warning systems and checklists and continuing training are all so important. In this case, nobody was hurt, and the pilots corrected their mistake before it became a disaster.",
