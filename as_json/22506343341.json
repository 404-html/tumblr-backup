Then, a little later, throw a billion or so dollars at the problem and brag, oh what a caring government we are! But youâd notice it doesnât equally announce how caring they are about the car-owning class when new expressways and road tunnels are built, or more neighbourhood roads widened, causing noise levels to go up.</p>\n\n<p>Public transport commuters also complain perennially about congestion. And the government will say thereâs a limit to what can be done to increase capacity within the bounds of affordability. The bus and metro companies cannot be expected to make losses on their bottom line, it says. It will insist that it is a bad idea to subsidise public transport on a continuing basis, even as ERP rates are subsidised on a continuing basis (as pointed out above).</p>",
