   "quote-text" : "<p>I don&rsquo;t want Transformers to be Atonement. I want it to be Die Hard or Iron Man or Terminator 2 or even True Lies. Cheesy? Over the top? Full of explosions and ambiguously sketched terrorists? Perfect! I don&rsquo;t care if the hero hangs the bad guy on a missile and fires it into a building while telling him he is fired, as long as he has a reason to do it, as opposed to just checking his watch and going, &ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s time for this scene in the movie.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>Just because we want smarter dialogue than &ldquo;Bumblebee, stop lubricating the man!&rdquo; doesn&rsquo;t mean we want characters talking about feelings or commitment or the meaning of life. There&rsquo;s hundreds of levels of dialogue intelligence between the retarded lines given to Sam&rsquo;s parents and a Shakespearean soliloquy. &ldquo;Yippee-ki-yay, motherfucker&rdquo; will do just fine for a &ldquo;dumb action movie,&rdquo; and even &ldquo;Yippee-ki-yay, Mister Falcon&rdquo; would be an improvement.</p>",
