   "quote-text" : "<p>I don&#8217;t want Transformers to be Atonement. I want it to be Die Hard or Iron Man or Terminator 2 or even True Lies. Cheesy? Over the top? Full of explosions and ambiguously sketched terrorists? Perfect! I don&#8217;t care if the hero hangs the bad guy on a missile and fires it into a building while telling him he is fired, as long as he has a reason to do it, as opposed to just checking his watch and going, &#8220;Oh, it&#8217;s time for this scene in the movie.&#8221;</p>\n\n<p>Just because we want smarter dialogue than &#8220;Bumblebee, stop lubricating the man!&#8221; doesn&#8217;t mean we want characters talking about feelings or commitment or the meaning of life. There&#8217;s hundreds of levels of dialogue intelligence between the retarded lines given to Sam&#8217;s parents and a Shakespearean soliloquy. &#8220;Yippee-ki-yay, motherfucker&#8221; will do just fine for a &#8220;dumb action movie,&#8221; and even &#8220;Yippee-ki-yay, Mister Falcon&#8221; would be an improvement.</p>",
