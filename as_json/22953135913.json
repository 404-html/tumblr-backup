   "quote-text" : "What does this mean? Among the uninitiated, itâs commonly assumed that taxonomists âfindâ new species in a willy nilly fashion as they wander around turning over logs or rooting through coral reefs. Such rooting around is, obviously, a key part of taxonomic discovery. But the results of this analysis hint that the process is much more akin to the way that a brilliant molecular geneticist âfindsâ a fundamentally new pattern of gene evolution or expressionâin both cases, the discovery is guided by both detailed expertise and a keen intuition honed by intensive study into a synthetic knowledge of both the living thing and its environment (whether ecological or biochemical). Like most great accomplishments this discovery is an art as much as a science, and allows the expert to reach eureka that few others would have recognized.",
