   "quote-text" : "<p>Most scientists are employed at colleges and universities where they are expected to do original research, write and publish their findings and teach students about their disciplines. Tenure, promotion and the ability to keep doing original research (grants) are all tied to a scientistâs ability to publish their results as peer reviewed scientific journal article.</p>\n\n<p>Any time spent editing Wikipedia would be time taken from lab work, field work, or scholarly writing.</p>\n\n<p>But PLoS Computational Biology Topic Pages turn the system around by making peer reviewed articles into Wikipedia entries. And by linking from Wikipedia to the original Topic Pages, Wikipedia users (and science term paper writers) can claim the authority of peer review for the original content.</p>",
