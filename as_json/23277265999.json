But there&#8217;s a very good reason for it: it means the Aspyr&#8217;s <a href=\"http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/star-wars-knights-old-republic/id416608891?mt=12\">unfortunate partnership with the Mac App Store</a> is being reconsidered. The Mac App Store (MAS) is an awful platform for gamers: no special deals and promotions throughout the year, no achievements, no social gaming, no automatic updating (I think?). Steam is where gamers want to be: it&#8217;s where our friends are, it&#8217;s where the best deals are, it&#8217;s got autoupdate, and it lets me swap games around so they don&#8217;t take up too much space on my paltry hard drive. If Aspyr is playing around with bringing games on to Steam &#8212; and I really don&#8217;t see LucasArts putting pressure on them to bring their almost-decade-old game to Steam &#8212; there&#8217;s <a href=\"http://www.gameagent.com/store/aspyr/DisplayCategoryProductListPage/categoryID.44906100\">a whole bunch of fantastic Mac games</a> which might be making their way to my favourite game store, at a price I might be able to afford. I&#8217;m hoping for more.</p>"
