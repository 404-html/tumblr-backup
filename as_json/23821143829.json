   "quote-text" : "<p>The other girl said, with a sneer, &ldquo;As if we care about your stupid karate.&rdquo; This is the type of reaction I feared, as a parent, especially given that <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asperger_syndrome\">ASD</a> children can go on for an hour about any topic that engages their interest.</p>\n\n<p>But the first girl turned to her friend and said, &ldquo;Well, I do care.&rdquo; And proceeded to talk with my son about his karate progress. She was, of course, one of the six.</p>"
