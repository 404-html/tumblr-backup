   "quote-text" : "<p>\"Each time he turns his attention upon us I am filled terror, wondering if I will be the next to have her legs ripped off with his wicked implement of torture,\" said soldier ant #078, referring to the set of Revlon tweezers the god reportedly borrows from his mother. \"I&#8217;ve lost three sisters that way. And I cannot continue living my life for a vindictive, uncaring divinity who would create so much unwarranted suffering. I defy you, oh Marcus!\"</p>\n\n<p>Others were more measured in their interpretation of the act, however, saying the ways of Marcus were not for &#8220;mere ants such as [them]&#8221; to understand.</p>\n\n<p>\"Many are forgetting the numerous times Marcus has saved us from the menace of the Cat,\" said drone #021, with nearby ants shuddering at the mere mention of the furry demon who has caused the colony so much misery. \"In truth, none of us would be here today if it were not for our god. No ant among us can deny it.\"</p>\n\n<p>\"And let us always remember the great kindness Marcus has shown our ancestors, as recounted in the ancient Parable of the Blueberry Muffin,\" he continued.</p>",
