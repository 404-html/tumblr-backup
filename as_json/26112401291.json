White, the perfect sentence is one from which nothing can be added or removed. Every word plays its part. In my more giddy moments I think that a simple comic strip featuring Calvin, a preternaturally bright six year-old, and Hobbes, his imaginary tiger friend, features some of the most lucid sentences committed to print. And when I sober up, I usually think exactly the same.</p>\n<p>Bill Wattersonâs Calvin and Hobbes ran between 1985 and 1995. His comic strip managed to infuse wondering (and wandering) on a cosmic scale into an ageless world of lazy Sunday afternoons, snow goons, and harassed babysitters. Iâm not saying that you should take moral and philosophical guidance from the inventor of Calvinball (a game that runs on chaos theory), but you could do much worse.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>So here, in no particular order, is a selection of quotes that nail everything from the meaning of life to special underwear. Enjoy.</p>\n<p><strong>On lifeâs constant little limitations</strong></p>\n<p>Calvin: You know, Hobbes, some days even my lucky rocket ship underpants donât help.</p>\n<p><strong>On expectations</strong></p>\n<p>Calvin: Everybody seeks happiness! Not me, though! Thatâs the difference between me and the rest of the world. Happiness isnât good enough for me! I demand euphoria!</p>\n<p><strong>On why we are scared of the dark</strong></p>\n<p>Calvin: I think night time is dark so you can imagine your fears with less distraction.</p>\n<p><strong>On the unspoken truth behind the education system</strong></p>\n<p>Calvin: As you can see, I have memorized this utterly useless piece of information long enough to pass a test question. I now intend to forget it forever. Youâve taught me nothing except how to cynically manipulate the system. Congratulations.</p>\n<p><strong>On the cruel reality of commercial art</strong></p>\n<p>Hobbes: Van Gogh wouldâve sold more than one painting if heâd put tigers in them.</p>\n<p><strong>On the tragedy of hipsters</strong></p>\n<p>Calvin: The world bores you when youâre cool.</p>\n<p><strong>On the tears of a clown</strong></p>\n<p>Calvin: Isnât it strange that evolution would give us a sense of humour? When you think about it, itâs weird that we have a physiological response to absurdity. We laugh at nonsense. We like it. We think itâs funny. Donât you think itâs odd that we appreciate absurdity? Why would we develop that way? How does it benefit us?</p>\n<p>Hobbes: I suppose if we couldnât laugh at things that donât make sense, we couldnât react to a lot of life.</p>\n<p>Calvin: (after a long pause) I canât tell if thatâs funny or really scary.</p>\n<p><strong>On the falling of sparrows (or providenceâs lack of a timetable)<br/></strong></p>\n<p>Calvin: Life is full of surprises, but never when you need one.</p>\n<p><strong>On why winter is the cruellest of seasons</strong></p>\n<p>Calvin: Getting an inch of snow is like winning 10 cents in the lottery.</p>\n<p><strong>On the gaping hole in contemporary artâs soul</strong></p>\n<p>Calvin: People always make the mistake of thinking art is created for them. But really, art is a private language for sophisticates to congratulate themselves on their superiority to the rest of the world. As my artistâs statement explains, my work is utterly incomprehensible and is therefore full of deep significance.</p>\n<p><strong>On playing Frankenstein with words</strong></p>\n<p>Calvin: Verbing weirds language.</p>\n<p><strong>On realising God is more Woody Allen than Michael Bay</strong></p>\n<p>Calvin: They say the world is a stage. But obviously the play is unrehearsed and everybody is ad-libbing his lines.</p>\n<p>Hobbes: Maybe thatâs why itâs hard to tell if weâre living in a tragedy or a farce.</p>\n<p>Calvin: We need more special effects and dance numbers.</p>\n<p><strong>On why ET is real</strong></p>\n<p>Calvin: Sometimes I think the surest sign that intelligent life exists elsewhere in the universe is that none of it has tried to contact us.</p>\n<p><strong>On looking yourself in the mirror</strong></p>\n<p>Hobbes: So the secret to good self-esteem is to lower your expectations to the point where theyâre already met?</p>\n<p><strong>On the future</strong></p>\n<p>Calvin: Trick or treat!</p>\n<p>Adult: Whereâs your costume? What are you supposed to be?</p>\n<p>Calvin: Iâm yet another resource-consuming kid in an overpopulated planet, raised to an alarming extent by Madison Avenue and Hollywood, poised with my cynical and alienated peers to take over the world when youâre old and weak. Am I scary, or what?</p>\n<p><strong>On the truth</strong></p>\n<p>Calvin: Itâs a magical world, Hobbes, olâ buddyâ¦Letâs go exploring!</p>\n</blockquote></blockquote>",
