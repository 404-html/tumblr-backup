Purrrrfect, right? It also gives us an opportunity to send you to our newly redesigned <a href=\"http://menus.nypl.org/\">Whatâs On The Menu</a> page, where you can transcribe menus just like this one from our extensive collection to make the information more accessible to researchers. Oh, wait, one more thing. We also have a food-related exhibition at our 42nd Street building right now - <a href=\"http://exhibitions.nypl.org/lunchhour/exhibits/show/lunchhour\">Lunch Hour NYC</a>. Itâs free and fabulous - just ask the <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/23/arts/lunch-hour-nyc-opens-at-the-new-york-public-library.html?pagewanted=all\">Times</a>. Learn more about it in this <a href=\"http://www.ny1.com/content/lets_eat/edible/164701/edible--public-library-exhibit-serves-up-the-history-of-lunch-in-the-city\">new piece by Edible Manhattan</a>. Anyone else hungry?</p></blockquote>\n\n<p>Aww!</p>",
