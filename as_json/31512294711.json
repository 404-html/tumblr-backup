   "quote-text" : "<p>They too can yield vital information about what the Stasi did. Most recordings are unlabelled, so workers here never know what they are about to listen to.</p>\n\n<p><br/>\nSome are bizarre. There is Erich Mielke, aged head of the Stasi as the revolution against communism approached, recorded in a secret meeting trying to explain to his senior colleagues the corrupting dangers posed to East German youth by punk, skinheads and heavy metal music.</p>\n\n<p>Another recording is of two agents trying clumsily to plant a bug in a flat, smashing a vase, unaware that their colleagues have already planted a bug and are listening in.</p>\n\n<p>In East Germany, it sometimes seems that everyone was spying on everyone else. Other recordings are tragic. A woman in a secret 1950s Stasi trial wails desperately as she is sentenced to death.</p>",
