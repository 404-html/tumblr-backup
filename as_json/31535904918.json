   "quote-text" : "In any other law-abiding country, such behaviour would be very suspicious. In India, however, there is a perfectly innocent explanation for it- no one, whether guilty or innocent, wants to tangle with the police. There exist ghettos in every country where people exist out of the mainstream of legality. Police find it difficult to investigate crimes in those places because everyone has something to hide, and it is next to impossible to get anyone to give evidence or otherwise co-operate  in investigations. In India, such a situation exists all over the country.",
