   "quote-text" : "<p>Back on the bridge, ECHELON tells Worf that Data is transmitting something on a subspace channel (apparently Starfleet can develop the most intrusive surveillance system in the universe, but they can&#8217;t make it any more accurate than Homeland Security&#8217;s no-fly list) so Riker looks around the bridge, sees all the commissioned officers he has available to him, does a quick scan of the ship&#8217;s manifest to see who&#8217;s on duty &#8230; and decides to send Wesley Freakin&#8217; Crusher to &#8220;discreetly&#8221; sneak a peek at Data. Worf says, &#8220;Uh, excuse me, Commander, but since I&#8217;m kind of in the security department and all, and I&#8217;m a big old Klingon, shouldn&#8217;t maybe I go check this out?&#8221;</p>\n\n<p>Riker replies, &#8220;I&#8217;m not going to lie to you, Worf: we all know that if there&#8217;s anything funky going on down there, you&#8217;re just going to get your ass kicked. So I&#8217;m sending the Boy Wonder and his giant brain instead.&#8221;</p>\n\n<p>Wesley jumps up from his console and shouts, &#8220;Wheee! I&#8217;m in Starfleet!&#8221; as he skips to the turbolift.</p>\n\n<p>Worf growls, but inside he&#8217;s secretly grateful that he&#8217;s staying safely on the bridge.</p>",
