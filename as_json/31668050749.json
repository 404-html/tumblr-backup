   "quote-text" : "<p>Back on the bridge, ECHELON tells Worf that Data is transmitting something on a subspace channel (apparently Starfleet can develop the most intrusive surveillance system in the universe, but they can&rsquo;t make it any more accurate than Homeland Security&rsquo;s no-fly list) so Riker looks around the bridge, sees all the commissioned officers he has available to him, does a quick scan of the ship&rsquo;s manifest to see who&rsquo;s on duty &hellip; and decides to send Wesley Freakin&rsquo; Crusher to &ldquo;discreetly&rdquo; sneak a peek at Data. Worf says, &ldquo;Uh, excuse me, Commander, but since I&rsquo;m kind of in the security department and all, and I&rsquo;m a big old Klingon, shouldn&rsquo;t maybe I go check this out?&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>Riker replies, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not going to lie to you, Worf: we all know that if there&rsquo;s anything funky going on down there, you&rsquo;re just going to get your ass kicked. So I&rsquo;m sending the Boy Wonder and his giant brain instead.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>Wesley jumps up from his console and shouts, &ldquo;Wheee! I&rsquo;m in Starfleet!&rdquo; as he skips to the turbolift.</p>\n\n<p>Worf growls, but inside he&rsquo;s secretly grateful that he&rsquo;s staying safely on the bridge.</p>",
