   "quote-text" : "<p>[&hellip;] Wesley decides he&rsquo;s had enough of this bullshit. </p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;I know this may finish me, but &ndash;&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>And Picard, the captain who recognized Wesley&rsquo;s intellect and promoted him to acting ensign, responds with three words that follow me to this day: &ldquo;Shut up, Wesley!&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>Trekkies around the country gasp in delight as an episode that was veering into &lsquo;The Last Outpost&rsquo; territory suddenly has redeeming value. Basement printing presses, silk screens, and button-makers go into over drive as entrepreneurial fans do what they do best. The convention market is flooded with the resulting merchandise, and children are still attending college today from the sales.</p>",
