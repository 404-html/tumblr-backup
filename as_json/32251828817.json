Then that night I recieved a DM. &#8216;You&#8217;ll get home some day &amp; ur b**ches throat will be cut &amp; ur son will be gone.&#8217;</p>\n\n<p>I got on to the authorities again but, polite and sympathetic as they were, there didn&#8217;t seem much that could be done.</p>\n\n<p>Every night for weeks I lost sleep over it. Listening for noises. Opening the door everday with trepidation. Trying to maintain a semblance of normality and not let my wife or son see that I was dying on the inside. Mortified that they might be in danger because of my big mouth or ancestry.</p>",
