   "quote-text" : "For more than 40 years, Big Bird has embodied the public broadcasting mission &ndash; harnessing the power of media for the good of every citizen, regardless of where they live or their ability to pay. Our system serves as a universally accessible resource for education, history, science, arts and civil discourse. <br/><br/>\nOver the course of a year, 91% of all U.S. television households tune in to their local PBS station. In fact, our service is watched by 81% of all children between the ages of 2-8. <br/><br/>\nEach day, the American public receives an enduring and daily return on investment that is heard, seen, read and experienced in public media broadcasts, apps, podcasts and online â all for the cost of about $1.35 per person per year.",
