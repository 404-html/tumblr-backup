Why is this comet expected to be so unique? Two reasons:<br/><br/>Astronomers predict that the comet will pass just <a href=\"http://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/sbdb.cgi?sstr=2012S1;cad=1#cad\">1.16 million miles from the Sun</a> as it swings around its perihelion, or closest approach. (This may seem like a lot, but rememberâthe Sun is big. If we were to scale the Sun down to the size of Earth, the comet would pass well within the orbits of dozens of satellites.) The close approach will melt enormous amounts of the cometâs ice, releasing dust and gas and forming what should be a magnificent tail.</p>\n<p>After it loops around the Sun and forms this tail, the comet should then <a href=\"http://www.skyandtelescope.com/community/skyblog/observingblog/A-Dream-Comet-Heading-Our-Way-171521041.html\">pass relatively close to Earth</a>ânot near enough to cause any worry, but close enough to put on a great show. Viewers in the Northern Hemisphere will get the best view as the <a href=\"http://www.astronomy.com/News-Observing/News/2012/09/New%20comet%20will%20light%20up%20the%20sky.aspx\">comet blooms</a> in the weeks approaching Christmas 2013.</p>\n<p>The comet could grow <a href=\"http://www.newscientist.com/blogs/shortsharpscience/2012/09/newly-spotted-comet-may-outshi.html\">as bright as the full moon</a>.</p>\n<p>Read More <a href=\"http://blogs.scientificamerican.com/observations/2012/10/05/once-in-a-civilization-comet-to-zip-past-earth-next-year/?WT_mc_id=SA_CAT_SPC_20121011\">here</a>Â </p>\n<p><em>Image Credit: </em><em>NASA/JPL-Caltech/UMD</em><em><a>Â </a></em></p></blockquote>\n\n<p>&ldquo;As bright as the full moon&rdquo;?!</p>",
