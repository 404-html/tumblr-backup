Text: âPlease donât feel silly because you are hurting. It hurts because it was important. It hurts because it mattered.â]</p>\n<p>I think, my human friends, that sometimes you get angry with yourself for being hurt. Because you feel like you arenât allowed to be hurting, because what made you hurt might be something not worth being upset over, or because you feel like other people have it worse.</p>\n\n<p>But thatâs not true. If you are hurting, then it means that it was important. That it mattered to you. And that is a legitimate reason to feel hurt. You are allowed to feel what you are feeling.</p>\n<p>My phrasing here has been borrowed from the lovely and talented John Green, from <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u9sYmz2lHXA&amp;feature=plcp\">this video.</a> He is a very nice man who writes nice books, and has a knack for saying things well. I hope he doesnât mind me using his words for a little while!</p></blockquote>\n\n<p>Too true.</p>",
