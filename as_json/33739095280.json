   "quote-text" : "<p>&ldquo;I have to tell you something,&rdquo; I said. I&rsquo;m sure I closed my eyes, because even though I had nothing to do with it, I hated myself for what I was about to say. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a new law. Maybe you don&rsquo;t know about it? When the hospital&rsquo;s budget was submitted this year to the state there was an additional clause. No abortions in this facility unless it&rsquo;s life or death. Doesn&rsquo;t matter if we can get insurance to pay or even if everyone is willing to waive their fees. The hospital is owned by the state.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>[..]</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;[..] The next step is for you to call the concerned politician who wrote the law, explain her medical condition, and then find out if she meets his criteria for life and death. Basically, you need his permission&rdquo; I paused, knowing what was coming next.</p>\n\n<p>[..]</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;You could also arrange to transfer her to a private hospital, but I&rsquo;m guessing she somehow hasn&rsquo;t qualified for Medicaid.&rdquo; His silence was reply enough.</p>",
