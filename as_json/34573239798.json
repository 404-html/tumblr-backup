   "quote-text" : "<p>A game artist himself, Capone wished that more developers had the guts to overreach as spectacularly as Molyneux did. As budgets skyrocketed &#8212; it now costs tens of millions to produce a major title &#8212; mainstream developers grew timid, afraid to venture outside genre conventions that had become as rigidly defined as a Hollywood rom-com&#8217;s, often revolving around the identical sort of immaculately rendered violence.</p>\n\n<p>Although he&#8217;d never met Molyneux, Capone began to see him as a tragicomic character, forever coming up with outlandish game concepts that were met with apathy or downright hostility. &#8220;I imagined him going through the supermarket with a digital recorder and coming up with ideas while shopping,&#8221; Capone says. &#8220;And over dinner, he&#8217;s rearranging his peas and saying. &#8216;Is this giving me a game idea?&#8217; And his wife is saying, &#8216;Shut up, Peter. Just eat your food.&#8217;&#8221;</p>",
