   "quote-text" : "<p>A game artist himself, Capone wished that more developers had the guts to overreach as spectacularly as Molyneux did. As budgets skyrocketed &ndash; it now costs tens of millions to produce a major title &ndash; mainstream developers grew timid, afraid to venture outside genre conventions that had become as rigidly defined as a Hollywood rom-com&rsquo;s, often revolving around the identical sort of immaculately rendered violence.</p>\n\n<p>Although he&rsquo;d never met Molyneux, Capone began to see him as a tragicomic character, forever coming up with outlandish game concepts that were met with apathy or downright hostility. &ldquo;I imagined him going through the supermarket with a digital recorder and coming up with ideas while shopping,&rdquo; Capone says. &ldquo;And over dinner, he&rsquo;s rearranging his peas and saying. &lsquo;Is this giving me a game idea?&rsquo; And his wife is saying, 'Shut up, Peter. Just eat your food.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>",
