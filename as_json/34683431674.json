   "quote-text" : "<p>An unknown number of stations are flooded to the ceiling and all seven under-river tubes linking the boroughs are also inundated &ndash; hardly the environment in which you&rsquo;d want to light up a system whose fabled third rail provides 625 volts of power to the trains. And it&rsquo;s not just any water that&rsquo;s swamping the system, it&rsquo;s salt water. Even after it all evaporates, there&rsquo;s still residue that would cause short circuits if power were switched on. That means a long, painstaking clean-up.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Every single piece of equipment &ndash; signals, contacts, everything &ndash; has to be disassembled, cleaned and dried,&rdquo; says Seaton. &ldquo;Then it can be reinstalled.&rdquo; The subway cars themselves, at least, are stored at high ground.</p>",
