   "quote-text" : "<p>An unknown number of stations are flooded to the ceiling and all seven under-river tubes linking the boroughs are also inundated &#8212; hardly the environment in which you&#8217;d want to light up a system whose fabled third rail provides 625 volts of power to the trains. And it&#8217;s not just any water that&#8217;s swamping the system, it&#8217;s salt water. Even after it all evaporates, there&#8217;s still residue that would cause short circuits if power were switched on. That means a long, painstaking clean-up.</p>\n\n<p>\"Every single piece of equipment &#8212; signals, contacts, everything &#8212; has to be disassembled, cleaned and dried,\" says Seaton. \"Then it can be reinstalled.\" The subway cars themselves, at least, are stored at high ground.</p>",
