   "quote-text" : "<p>\"I looked [Mitt Romney] in the eye as we were leaving,\" recalls Goodridge. \"And I said, &#8216;Governor Romney, tell me â what would you suggest I say to my 8 year-old daughter about why her mommy and her ma can&#8217;t get married because you, the governor of her state, are going to block our marriage?&#8217;\"</p>\n\n<p>His response, according to Goodridge: &#8220;I don&#8217;t really care what you tell your adopted daughter. Why don&#8217;t you just tell her the same thing you&#8217;ve been telling her the last eight years.&#8221;</p>\n\n<p>Romneyâs retort enraged a speechless Goodridge; he didn&#8217;t care, and by referring to her biological daughter as &#8220;adopted,&#8221; it was clear he hadn&#8217;t even been listening. By the time she was back in the hallway, she was reduced to tears.</p>\n\n<p>\"I really kind of lost it,\" says Goodridge. \"I&#8217;ve never stood before someone who had no capacity for empathy. It went behind flat affect. It was a complete lack of ability or motivation to understand other people.\"</p>",
