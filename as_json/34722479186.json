   "quote-text" : "<p>&ldquo;I looked [Mitt Romney] in the eye as we were leaving,&rdquo; recalls Goodridge. &ldquo;And I said, &lsquo;Governor Romney, tell me â what would you suggest I say to my 8 year-old daughter about why her mommy and her ma can&rsquo;t get married because you, the governor of her state, are going to block our marriage?&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>His response, according to Goodridge: &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t really care what you tell your adopted daughter. Why don&rsquo;t you just tell her the same thing you&rsquo;ve been telling her the last eight years.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>Romneyâs retort enraged a speechless Goodridge; he didn&rsquo;t care, and by referring to her biological daughter as &ldquo;adopted,&rdquo; it was clear he hadn&rsquo;t even been listening. By the time she was back in the hallway, she was reduced to tears.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;I really kind of lost it,&rdquo; says Goodridge. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never stood before someone who had no capacity for empathy. It went behind flat affect. It was a complete lack of ability or motivation to understand other people.&rdquo;</p>",
