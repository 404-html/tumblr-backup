Youâre asked to rate photos, taken over the past few days, by the Civil Air Patrol, of disaster-affected areas, and note whether the building damage is light, moderate, or heavy, and from your answers, combined with the judgement of many others, helps inform FEMA as to where their teams are most needed. Think of it as Hot or Not with a humanitarian bent.</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>If youâre missing the NYPL Labs projects or just want to help out, please spend a few minutes of your time (or more) and help make a difference informing disaster responders.</div>\n<div></div>\n<div><a href=\"http://sandy.locative.us\"><img align=\"middle\" height=\"213\" src=\"http://img580.imageshack.us/img580/1949/mapmillcrowdsourcedimag.jpg\" width=\"375\"/></a></div></blockquote>\n\n<p>Oh wow. Crowdsourcing relief efforts in NYC!</p>",
