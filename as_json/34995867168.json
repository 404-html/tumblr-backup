Our Facilities team has worked around the clock to clear debris, repair minor damage and battle power outages to get the branches ready to serve New Yorkers, who have flocked to libraries in the wake of Hurricane Sandy to charge their devices, talk to neighbors, enjoy free programming, use free internet and more. It is a clear reminder of how important libraries are to their communities. Five branches â Soundview and Van Cortlandt in The Bronx, South Beach and Dongan Hills in Staten Island, and Hamilton Fish in Manhattan â will remain closed, but we are working to get them open ASAP.Â  Also, please note, NYPL has extended the due dates on 390,000 items due between October 26 and November 11 until November 13.</p></blockquote>\n\n<p>Viva la bibliothÃ¨que!</p>",
