A few months earlier, on Magid&rsquo;s ninth birthday, a group of very nice looking white boys with meticulous manners had turned up on the doorstep and asked for Mark Smith.</p>\n\n<p>&lsquo;Mark? No Mark here,&rsquo; Alsana had said, bending down to their level with a genial smile. 'Only the family Iqbal in here. You have the wrong house.&rsquo;</p>\n\n<p>But before she had finished the sentence, Magid had dashed to the door, ushering his mother out of view. </p>\n\n<p>'Hi, guys.&rsquo;<br/>\n'Hi, Mark.&rsquo; <br/>\n'Off to the chess club, Mum.&rsquo; <br/>\n'Yes, M-M-Mark,&rsquo; said Alsana, close to tears at this final snub, the final replacement of 'Mum&rsquo; for 'Amma&rsquo;. 'Do not be late, now.&rsquo; 'I GIVE YOU A GLORIOUS NAME LIKE MAGID MAHFOOZ MURSHED MUBTASIM IQBAL!&rsquo; Samad had yelled after Magid when he returned home that evening and whipped up the stairs like a bullet to hide in his room. 'AND YOU WANT TO BE CALLED MARK SMITH!&rsquo;</p>",
