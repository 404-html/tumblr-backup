   "quote-text" : "<p>There was a mutual, silent anger as each acknowledged the painful incident that was being referred to. A few months earlier, on Magid&#8217;s ninth birthday, a group of very nice looking white boys with meticulous manners had turned up on the doorstep and asked for Mark Smith.</p>\n\n<p>'Mark? No Mark here,' Alsana had said, bending down to their level with a genial smile. 'Only the family Iqbal in here. You have the wrong house.'</p>\n\n<p>But before she had finished the sentence, Magid had dashed to the door, ushering his mother out of view. </p>\n\n<p>'Hi, guys.'<br/>\n&#8216;Hi, Mark.&#8217; <br/>\n&#8216;Off to the chess club, Mum.&#8217; <br/>\n&#8216;Yes, M-M-Mark,&#8217; said Alsana, close to tears at this final snub, the final replacement of &#8216;Mum&#8217; for &#8216;Amma&#8217;. &#8216;Do not be late, now.&#8217; &#8216;I GIVE YOU A GLORIOUS NAME LIKE MAGID MAHFOOZ MURSHED MUBTASIM IQBAL!&#8217; Samad had yelled after Magid when he returned home that evening and whipped up the stairs like a bullet to hide in his room. &#8216;AND YOU WANT TO BE CALLED MARK SMITH!&#8217;</p>",
