   "quote-text" : "<p>Until Hedges came along, we had no idea about how either species was spread historically. But the woodcuts revealed that they were separated by an invisible line, which kept the common furniture beetle to the north and the Mediterranean one to the south. For four centuries, where one beetle was found, the other was not. While the common furniture beetle is more sensitive to higher temperatures and low humidity, it seems likely that it was kept out of the south by competition from its Mediterranean cousin.</p>\n\n<p>But this separation is no more. Both beetles are now found throughout most of Europe. As trade and commerce across the continent increased, the beetles expandedânot just in woodblocks, but also furniture, housing materials, and more. The stable indoor environments of buildings would have sheltered them form the climatic predilections, and allowed them to gain footholds in new areas.</p>",
