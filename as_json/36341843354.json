   "quote-text" : "<p>However, among the documents are a handful which show that many of the most sensitive papers from Britain&rsquo;s late colonial era were not hidden away, but simply destroyed. These papers give the instructions for systematic destruction issued in 1961 after Iain Macleod, secretary of state for the colonies, directed that post-independence governments should not get any material that &ldquo;might embarrass Her Majesty&rsquo;s government&rdquo;, that could &ldquo;embarrass members of the police, military forces, public servants or others eg police informers&rdquo;, that might compromise intelligence sources, or that might &ldquo;be used unethically by ministers in the successor government&rdquo;.</p>\n\n<p>Among the documents that appear to have been destroyed were: records of the abuse of Mau Mau insurgents detained by British colonial authorities, who were tortured and sometimes murdered; reports that may have detailed the alleged massacre of 24 unarmed villagers in Malaya by soldiers of the Scots Guards in 1948; most of the sensitive documents kept by colonial authorities in Aden, where the army&rsquo;s Intelligence Corps operated a secret torture centre for several years in the 1960s; and every sensitive document kept by the authorities in British Guiana, a colony whose policies were heavily influenced by successive US governments and whose post-independence leader was toppled in a coup orchestrated by the CIA.</p>",
