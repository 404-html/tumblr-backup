   "quote-text" : "<p>Holbrooke had handed off an important but tough assignment. For months, the Obama administration&#8217;s relations with Pakistan had been in steady decline. Instead of diplomacy, Washington was increasingly employing brass-knuckle techniques, such as threatening to cut back on aid. &#8220;When I get calls from the White House, they say, &#8216;Dial up the pain,&#8217;&#8221; Munter tells me. &#8220;In Islamabad, they don&#8217;t respond well to dialing up the pain.&#8221;</p>\n\n<p>[..]</p>\n\n<p>It wasn&#8217;t that Munter was against drone strikes. &#8220;We prevented major attacks,&#8221; Munter tells me. &#8220;To me, that&#8217;s my job, and I&#8217;m proud we did it.&#8221; He also thinks allegations that drone strikes kill civilians are trumped up. &#8220;We have people who bring us the bodies of little girls,&#8221; he says, stretching out his arms as if he were carrying a small corpse, &#8220;and say drones killed them. They&#8217;re making it up, or they&#8217;re willfully believing lies.&#8221;</p>\n\n<p>[..]</p>\n\n<p>Yet insiders and outsiders agree that the main reason for his demise was not his personality, bossy or otherwise, but the fact that he was off message. âMunterâs argument was that it would be much better to engage Pakistan diplomatically rather than just to rely on pressure,â says Vali Nasr, who served as a senior adviser to Holbrooke and is now at Johns Hopkins University. âThe real issue was that he was not on the same page as Washington.â</p>",
