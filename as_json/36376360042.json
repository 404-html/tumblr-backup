   "quote-text" : "<p>Holbrooke had handed off an important but tough assignment. For months, the Obama administration&rsquo;s relations with Pakistan had been in steady decline. Instead of diplomacy, Washington was increasingly employing brass-knuckle techniques, such as threatening to cut back on aid. &ldquo;When I get calls from the White House, they say, &lsquo;Dial up the pain,&rsquo;&rdquo; Munter tells me. &ldquo;In Islamabad, they don&rsquo;t respond well to dialing up the pain.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>[..]</p>\n\n<p>It wasn&rsquo;t that Munter was against drone strikes. &ldquo;We prevented major attacks,&rdquo; Munter tells me. &ldquo;To me, that&rsquo;s my job, and I&rsquo;m proud we did it.&rdquo; He also thinks allegations that drone strikes kill civilians are trumped up. &ldquo;We have people who bring us the bodies of little girls,&rdquo; he says, stretching out his arms as if he were carrying a small corpse, &ldquo;and say drones killed them. They&rsquo;re making it up, or they&rsquo;re willfully believing lies.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>[..]</p>\n\n<p>Yet insiders and outsiders agree that the main reason for his demise was not his personality, bossy or otherwise, but the fact that he was off message. âMunterâs argument was that it would be much better to engage Pakistan diplomatically rather than just to rely on pressure,â says Vali Nasr, who served as a senior adviser to Holbrooke and is now at Johns Hopkins University. âThe real issue was that he was not on the same page as Washington.â</p>",
