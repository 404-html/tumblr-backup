   "quote-text" : "It&rsquo;s been a Big Taxonomy couple of weeks around here for a few reasons. The biggest is that my recently graduated Ph.D. student Chris Borkent has just published the first big paper from his thesis work &ndash; a taxonomic revision of the fungus gnat genus Leptomorphus (see Borkent and Wheeler 2012 under Publications). It&rsquo;s 117 pages of species descriptions, illustrations, keys and phylogenetic relationships. &ldquo;Who cares?&rdquo; you may ask. Well, lots of people do, and lots more people should. Fungus gnats, you see, are one of the most diverse and abundant groups of Diptera in forest habitats, where they play a major role in food webs and ecological dynamics. So, if you care about sustainable forest management, or decomposition and nutrient cycling, or the conservation of forest biodiversity, or the food webs that sustain birds and salamanders and small mammals, then you should care about fungus gnats.",
