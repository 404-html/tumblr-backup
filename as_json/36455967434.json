   "quote-text" : "<p>Frequently, our discussions strayed away from the paper at hand; they turned into commentaries on the entire field. Questions such as âIs it possible to have an empty ecological niche?â and âAre all organisms ecosystem engineers?â developed into âWhat is ecologyâs role in conservation?â and âShould ecologists be environmental activists?â</p>\n\n<p>For us, in stark contrast to earlier ecologists describing undisturbed natural systems, questions of conservation and global applications are always immediate. In this way, we are a new generation of ecologists, training ourselves from the start to wrestle with the new dramas in ecology. We discussed ecologyâs proper role in society long and hard throughout the semester, butâlike most wicked problemsâthese questions have no definitive answers.</p>"
