   "quote-text" : "<p>Public schools are set up to educate children first and foremost, but also to ensure that they learn things deemed useful to society, rather than, say, yoga or skywriting. Certainly it is the right of parents to educate their children about things like yoga and skywriting (or how to practice Christianity or Islam), but they do not have the right to demand that society pay for it.</p>\n\n<p>It may be unfashionable to say so, but the public does have a right to make sure that children schooled on public money learn things that we all consider useful. After all, these children will eventually be the doctors, scientists and engineers that fuel the economy and pay our retirement costs. This is not to say that vouchers can&rsquo;t be useful. But without some controls on where the vouchers are going, they may create more problems than they solve.</p>",
