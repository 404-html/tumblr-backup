   "quote-text" : "Incidentally, the other uniformed services of New York City have their own monikers. FDNY firefighters are known as &#8220;The Bravest,&#8221; a title richly deserved long before their extraordinary heroism on 9/11. Sanitation workers are apparently known as the &#8220;Strongest&#8221; (although Manhattan apartment dwellers would probably vote for &#8220;Loudest&#8221;) and City Corrections Officers are known as the &#8220;Boldest,&#8221; which shows that any pattern can be pushed too far. Boldest? I&#8217;d nominate New York City public school teachers for that one.",
