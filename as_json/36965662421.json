   "quote-text" : "Incidentally, the other uniformed services of New York City have their own monikers. FDNY firefighters are known as &ldquo;The Bravest,&rdquo; a title richly deserved long before their extraordinary heroism on 9/11. Sanitation workers are apparently known as the &ldquo;Strongest&rdquo; (although Manhattan apartment dwellers would probably vote for &ldquo;Loudest&rdquo;) and City Corrections Officers are known as the &ldquo;Boldest,&rdquo; which shows that any pattern can be pushed too far. Boldest? I&rsquo;d nominate New York City public school teachers for that one.",
