   "quote-text" : "When my son came to me at age 15 and said, &ldquo;Mom, I&rsquo;m gay,&rdquo; I cried &hellip; not because he was gay, but because I know the world can be cruel, and one day I would have to let him go to face it without me. To me, you are just like him &hellip; precious, irreplaceable and bravely facing an uncertain world. Just like my own child, during this holiday season and always, you have a welcomed place in my home and in my heart.",
