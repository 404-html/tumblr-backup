   "quote-text" : "<p>Jane Austen&#8217;s &#8220;Pride and Prejudice&#8221; is a story about love. It is also about inheritance and income gaps. The heroine, Elizabeth Bennet, comes from a well-off family, the second of five daughters. But her financial future is dark because, in the absence of sons, her father&#8217;s estate will pass to a cousin. Elizabeth&#8217;s suitor, the brooding Mr Darcy, is fabulously wealthy. To her mother&#8217;s horror, Elizabeth at first rebuffs him.</p>\n\n<p>All ends happily when Elizabeth decides that Darcy is ravishing after all. But her motherâs reaction is a rational response to the realities of income distribution and social mobility in Austen&#8217;s time. In an entertaining analysis of inequality, &#8220;The Haves and the Have Nots&#8221;, Branko Milanovic works out that by marrying Mr Darcy, Elizabeth would increase her income 100-fold. Without him, she would have the same income as a merchant seaman. With him she would be catapulted into the top 0.1%.</p>",
