Of course, women are underrepresented in some disciplines, but it also suggestsÂ <strong>women may be more reluctant to come forward:</strong></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>âOne can speculate that there also may be a tendency for women to be less willing than men to push themselves forward, which may lead to editors being less aware of themâ</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Why might that be? And what is to be done about it?</p>\n<p>This topic was recently discussed at the SpotOn London conference, in the session:Â <a href=\"http://www.nature.com/spoton/event/spoton-london-2012-women-in-science/\" title=\"WIS\">Women in science â Improving visibility of female scientists online and offline</a>.</p>\n<p>The session was chaired byÂ <a href=\"http://localhost/Pettorelli\">Nathalie Pettorelli</a>Â andÂ <a href=\"http://localhost/WaspWoman\">Seirian Sumner</a>Â and on the panel was blogger and self proclaimed university gender equality championÂ <a href=\"http://localhost/AtheneDonald\">Athene Donald</a>,Â Judith Willetts of the British Society for Immunology, and Guardian science correspondent Alok Jha.</p>\n<p>Athene Doland has since written aÂ <a href=\"http://www.nature.com/spoton/2012/11/spoton-london-2012-to-blog-or-not-to-blog/\" title=\"Athene Donald's post\">comprehensive blog post</a>Â on the topic which also details the topics that were discussed:</p>\n<ul><li>Â Are there risks in openly identifying yourself as female?</li>\n<li>How can social media help raise your profile?</li>\n<li>What are the wider benefits for your career?</li>\n<li>How do you begin?</li>\n<li>What is the purpose of blogging?</li>\n</ul><p>The idea that women are reluctant to put themselves forward was voiced by Alok Jha in reference to the Guardianâs ownÂ <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/science\" title=\"Guardian\">network of science blogs</a>, which sorely lacks female voices. He said that whereas men jump at the chance to blog, women have been reluctant to come forward. In the future though, they may work more closely with their bloggers, to help women overcome their concerns about airing their ideas online.</p>\n<p>But why is it that women feel so reluctant when men do not? Is it something inherently âfemale?â or is it just that women are more likely to get a hard time? Many in the audience said they were put-off by the reaction to bloggerÂ <a href=\"http://skepchick.org/2011/09/mom-dont-read-this/\" title=\"Skipchick\">Rebecca Watson</a>Â and feared the negative responses from trolls.</p>\n<p>If you are thinking about blogging, but arenât sure if itâs a good idea or where to start, here are ourÂ <strong>top five tips and some useful links</strong>Â to get you thinking.</p>\n<p>1. Think of it asÂ <strong>online mentoring</strong>, says Athene Donald, who was inspired by another female science blogger,Â <a href=\"http://science-professor.blogspot.co.uk/2012/07/apparently-there-is-me-in-mentor.html\" title=\"FSP\">FemaleScienceprofessor</a>.</p>\n<p>2. If youâre thinking of starting a blog, check out ourÂ <strong><a href=\"http://blogs.nature.com/naturejobs/2012/09/28/social-media-tips-for-scientists\" title=\"Social media tips for scientists\">social media tips for scientists</a></strong>, which will give you advice on how to start, and potential pitfalls.</p>\n<p>3. If you think you are too busy to blog, remember that having an online presenceÂ <strong><a href=\"http://www.nature.com/spoton/2012/11/spoton-london-2012-a-call-for-women-to-get-online-or-lose-out/\" title=\"Time\">need not take up all that much of your time.</a></strong><a href=\"http://www.nature.com/spoton/2012/11/spoton-london-2012-a-call-for-women-to-get-online-or-lose-out/\" title=\"Time\">Â </a></p>\n<p>4. If you are reluctant to âself promoteâ consider why that is. If society sends messages to young women that they shouldnât be self promoting, hereâs your chance to change that rhetoric. And besides, if youâre writing about your work, and people are interested in it, then youâre promoting your science, not your âselfâ.</p>\n<p>5. You donât need to go it alone. Why not join up with a group of colleagues or like minded women or men, and set up a blog together? Or else, start by contributing guest posts on established blogs, likeÂ <em>Naturejobs</em>, where we are happy to host relevant guest posts from our readers about their experiences in their science careers. So get in touch Â with your ideas, and start blogging!</p>\n<p><em>Any female science bloggers out there? Send me an ask and I will promote you on this blog.Â </em></p>\n<p><em>âAmanda</em></p>\n</div>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Do it!</p>",
