   "quote-text" : "<p>\"Were the second law to be repealed, random particles would collect and organize themselves instead of dissipating, which could affect such basic processes as combustion, digestion, evaporation, convectionâthat sort of thing,\" Columbia University superstring theorist Dr. Brian Greene said. \"There wouldn&#8217;t be much sunlight, either, because all stars, including our sun, would be collecting photons from surrounding space instead of emitting solar radiation. Oh, and the universe would begin to contract rather than expand, which could possibly turn back the flow of time itself, sending our cosmos spiraling inward toward a reverse Big Bang, a sort of &#8216;Big Crunch,&#8217; if you will.\" </p>\n\n<p>\"In light of all this,\" Greene continued, \"I would sincerely hope that our nation&#8217;s legislators think long and hard before making any decisions to amend or repeal this law.\"</p>",
