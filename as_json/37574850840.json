The owl, with a wingspan of more than three feet, left its crate, lower right, a second after the door was opened. A crowd watched as the owl flied away silently. Three weeks ago, the bird was found on the ground, emaciated and grasping a gull. Kestrel SkyHawk from the wildlife center said it would likely find a mate next year when it flies to more familiar habitat in Northern Alaska or Northern Canada.
