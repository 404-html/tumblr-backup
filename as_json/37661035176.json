   "quote-text" : "<p>So - how many Lego bricks, stacked one on top of the other, would it take to destroy the bottom brick?</p>\n\n<p>Ian Johnston and the team do two more tests to be sure we hadn&rsquo;t just happened upon the strongest Lego brick in existence. And in fact they were impressed at the consistency of Lego manufacture.</p>\n\n<p>The average maximum force the bricks can stand is 4,240N. That&rsquo;s equivalent to a mass of 432kg (950lbs). If you divide that by the mass of a single brick, which is 1.152g, then you get the grand total of bricks a single piece of Lego could support: 375,000.</p>\n\n<p>So, 375,000 bricks towering 3.5km (2.17 miles) high is what it would take to break a Lego brick.</p>",
