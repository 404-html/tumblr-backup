Then, it lost thrust. It looked for a second like the rocket was going to settle nicely back down on the pad, but it didnât. Vanguard buckled under its own weight, its fuel tanks ruptured and exploded. The rocket was destroyed and the launch pad badly damaged as both were engulfed in flames.</em></p>\n<p><em>âWithin the carnage, the satellite interpreted the loss of thrust as weightlessness in orbit and separated from the rocket. It was thrown clear, landing a short distance away with its transmitters proudly sending out a beacon signal.â</em></p>\n</blockquote></blockquote>\n\n<p>Aw, poor thing.</p>",
