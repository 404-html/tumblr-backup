They are the ghost of a child that has been murdered and/or hasnât been baptised.Â </p>\n<p>They might try to let someone know of their horrid fate by appearing in front of strangers, leading them to their corpse. But some of the time, they just plain try to kill their murderer themselves. Most of the time their murderer is their mother, since women who gave birth outside of marriage back in the day sometimes killed their children to avoid the social stigma.Â </p>\n<p>One interesting thing is that theyâre one of the few types of ghosts known to actually age. Theyâre almost always murdered as babies, but appear as slightly older children. There are even stories of adult ones, appearing in front of their mother to tell her what they could have become if sheâd let them live.Â </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Oh wow. That&#8217;s beautiful.</p>",
