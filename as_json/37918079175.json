The tardigrade is reared up over something brown, and looks like it is looking around. Something green is behind it, and it is on a blue background. TEXT: âIt doesnât matter if youâre not the best at something. What matters is that you try, and donât give up.â]</p>\n\n<p>(Image from <a href=\"http://www.sierraclub.org/sierra/201203/grapple-charismatic-microfauna-tarigrade-127.aspx\">here</a>)</p>\n<p>This is Tardigrade!She is very small, and likes to be in moss. And even though is she very small, and canât move very fast, she never, ever gives up. She is very tough, and can live through almost anything! Itâs because she knows that being the best is not important, itâs that you keep going. Your strength lies in your tenacity, as it does with her.</p></blockquote>\n\n<p>This one&#8217;s for everybody in grad school everywhere. /cc @isla_es</p>",
