The happiness of others makes one a slave. \r\nYoko Ono: What if your own happiness makes others unhappy. \r\nAyn Rand: Your happiness does not preclude that you are not making other people happy. Actually quite the opposite. If everyone works on their success and achievements this will bring the maximum amount of happiness to everyone. \r\nSidney Nolan: History Ms. Rand dictates many things. We are always inside it and it is always inside us. We cannot escape it in most of our acts of will thoughts and concepts. Struggling with it is a purpose in itself.
