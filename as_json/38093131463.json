A hard heart. Yet even he can muster a bit of empathy every now and then.\r\nSidney Nolan: When Ms. Rands idea of individualism is amplified to the extreme things like Vietnam happen. \r\nAyn Rand: I am not isolated. I have no contempt for others. Millions of people read my books and find my thoughts inspirational. I hardly spend my time on the sidelines in a trash can grumping. \r\nJim Henson: Not yet anyway.",
