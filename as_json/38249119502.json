   "quote-text" : "<p>His face turned cold, and his eyes were full of calculated rage. &ldquo;Then I&rsquo;m going to kill myself,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to jump out of this car right now and kill myself.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>That was it. After the knife incident, I told him that if he ever said those words again, I would take him straight to the mental hospital, no ifs, ands, or buts. I did not respond, except to pull the car into the opposite lane, turning left instead of right.</p>\n\n<p>[..]</p>\n\n<p>Michael was in a full-blown fit by then, screaming and hitting. I hugged him close so he couldn&rsquo;t escape from the car. He bit me several times and repeatedly jabbed his elbows into my rib cage. Iâm still stronger than he is, but I won&rsquo;t be for much longer.</p>\n\n<p>[..]</p>\n\n<p>At least we have health insurance now. I recently accepted a position with a local college, giving up my freelance career because when you have a kid like this, you need benefits. You&rsquo;ll do anything for benefits. No individual insurance plan will cover this kind of thing.</p>\n\n<p>For days, my son insisted that I was lying &ndash; that I made the whole thing up so that I could get rid of him. The first day, when I called to check up on him, he said, &ldquo;I hate you. And I&rsquo;m going to get my revenge as soon as I get out of here.&rdquo;</p>",
