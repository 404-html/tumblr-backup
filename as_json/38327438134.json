   "quote-text" : "<p>When your first impulse after yet one more mass shooting is to tell me one more time that guns are the answer, I seriously doubt that youâre responsible enough to own one. See that dead shooter over there? He thought guns were the answer too. I donât know what he thought the problem was, but his answer is damned obvious. If you tell me the same thing he did, I donât want you and guns together anywhere near me.</p>\n\n<p>The same is true when someone brings up regulation and your response is to talk about toasters and automobiles. That you donât understand how much cars are regulated makes me sad. That you canât or wonât understand the difference between something that is incidentally dangerous and a weapon designed to be deadly makes me want to take the weapon away until you do. A gun has one purpose: to kill things. [&hellip;]</p>\n\n<p>[&hellip;]</p>\n\n<p>When your response to the idea of more regulation or taking certain kinds of guns out of circulation is âCome and get mineâ¦if you dareâ, that is exactly what I want to do, as soon as possible. You are the last person on Earth who should have a gun.</p>",
