   "conversation-text" : "(I am working the register over Christmas.)\r\n\r\nMe: âFind everything today?â\r\n\r\nCustomer: âYup.â\r\n\r\n(Note: she is silent through the transaction, which includes a gift card.)\r\n\r\nMe: âHow much would you like on this?â\r\n\r\nCustomer: âOh, sorry. Can I have $150?â\r\n\r\nMe: âNo problem.â\r\n\r\nCustomer: *after paying* âCan you do me a favor?â *she hands me the gift card* âThe next customer you see that you think could use this, could you give it to them?â\r\n\r\nMe: *stunned* ââ¦Of course!â\r\n\r\n(After a minute another customer comes up, a visibly upset young woman.)\r\n\r\nMe: âHi! How are you?â\r\n\r\nCustomer #2: âIâm okay, thanks.â\r\n\r\n(Clearly she is not ok, but she is trying very hard to be pleasant. She is getting very basic items: milk, bread, eggs, etc. Nothing very festive.)\r\n\r\nMe: âSo your total comes out to $0.00.â\r\n\r\nCustomer: âWhat?â\r\n\r\nMe: âThe person before you gave me a $150 gift card to use for the next person I thought could use it. You look like youâre having a rough day, so here are your groceries, and thereâs about $130 left on this card.â\r\n\r\n(The customer just started crying. Once she could, she thanked me about 100 times. Made my whole Christmas season.)\r\n",
