   "quote-text" : "For older people, you know who have sort of been through all of this stuff, thereâs this stigma about it. âWell why canât you just feel better?â And I know, because I did it for years. âLike why canât you just feel better?; I donât know! If I could just fucking feel better, I would, but I canât. And then you get angry about it, and you just get frustrated, and itâs such an ouroboros cycle and if youâre the snake you have got to let go of that tail and get out of that cycle.",
