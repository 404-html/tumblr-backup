   "quote-text" : "Such actions in chaotic situations don&rsquo;t just put the well-intentioned citizen at risk, of course. According to Robert McMenomy, an assistant special agent in charge in the San Francisco division of the FBI, they increase the danger for innocent bystanders. They also make law enforcement officers&rsquo; jobs more difficult. &ldquo;In a scenario like that,&rdquo; he told me in a recent conversation, &ldquo;they wouldn&rsquo;t know who was good or who was bad, and it would divert them from the real threat.&rdquo;"
