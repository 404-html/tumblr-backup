You get to live in the story as any character for as long as you like. And when you come out of the story, almost no time has passed in the real world.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>&hellip; have you considered reading <em><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Eyre_Affair\">The Eyre Affair</a></em> and its sequels by Jasper Fforde? Because if that idea intrigues you, you might find a lot to like in the <em><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thursday_Next\">Thursday Next</a></em> series.\n</p>",
