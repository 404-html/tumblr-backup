So yeah, someone might have an iPhone, but maybe the iPhone 4 just got released so they got a really great deal on the 3S instead of getting the 4, etc. I just find this aspect of this discussion, which comes up with a weird degree of frequency, completely illogical.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>All this.Â </p>\n</blockquote>",
