I have the opportunity to record something! What should I do?</p></blockquote>\n\n<p>Siiiiince you ask &hellip;</p>\n\n<ol><li>Do a bit from a radio play! <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/writersroom/scripts/warhorses-of-letters-s1-ep1\">Here&rsquo;s a mostly SFW transcript you can read from</a>. <a href=\"http://bbclinksmachine.appspot.com/writersroom/scripts/porshia\">Here&rsquo;s a very not-safe-for-work one</a>. <a href=\"http://bbclinksmachine.appspot.com/writersroom/scripts/search/platform/radio\">Here are more</a>. I think they both show off what you can do with just your voice that you really can&rsquo;t do in any other medium, written or performed.\n</li>\n\n<li>Make up your own story. Pretend like you&rsquo;re telling someone a bedtime story, or the plot of a movie you like, or anything really. Must have at least six characters in it, so you can show off your voice. Throw in extra characters &ndash; I remember doing an improv comedy skit in 1996 in which we did &ldquo;Jack and the Beanstalk&rdquo;, except Jack was just interested in girls, and the Giant had a grandmother who was a sweet old thing really. Even if it&rsquo;s crap, it&rsquo;s voice-acting/improv practice!\n</li>\n\n<li>Write and then perform a comedy monologue. <a href=\"http://monologues.co.uk/Sketches/Setting_Fire_to_Policeman.htm\">Here&rsquo;s a monologue</a> that Peter Sellers does as an old man, reminiscing fondly about the things kids would do in his village when he was just a wee mite. The whole gag is to do something completely absurd while making it sound like the most ordinary thing in the world.\n</li>\n\n<li>Eh, do the Aristocrats. Or don&rsquo;t. Or do. (Just don&rsquo;t use that crazy voice like scratching your nails on a whiteboard (or do)).</li>\n\n</ol><p>&lsquo;smy wishlist!</p>",
