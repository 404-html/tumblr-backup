   "quote-text" : "The chances of there being no gay footballer among [the 3,200 Premier League players in the past 20 years] is 1 in 10 to the power of 21, which is one and 21 noughts. To illustrate how unlikely that is - if the entire earth&rsquo;s surface was covered with drawing pins edge to edge, the chance of you picking up one specific drawing pin at random would be 200 times higher than the chance there being no gay player in the Premier League over the past 20 years.",
