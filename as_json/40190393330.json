   "quote-text" : "Wanna make a monster? Take the parts of yourself that make you uncomfortable - your weaknesses, bad thoughts, vanities, and hungers - and pretend theyâre across the room. Itâs too ugly to be human. Itâs too ugly to be you. Children are afraid of the dark because they have nothing real to work with. Adults are afraid of themselves."
