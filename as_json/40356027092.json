   "quote-text" : "A friend mentions that any random Wodehouse is his go-to subway reading &ndash; perfect for dipping into, no emotional commitment, it doesn&rsquo;t matter if you don&rsquo;t finish it. Indeed, you might have already finished it: The remarkable consistency and volume of his output means you can be pretty far into something before it dawns on you that you&rsquo;ve read it before. Even his titles are designed to blur the lines. [..] This is in fact a virtue of Wodehouseâs work, although as we learn in a new collection of his letters, the author was sensitive to accusations that he was continually raking over the same fictional ground. In 1932, Wodehouse grumbled about a review by J. B. Priestley, who &ldquo;called attention to the thing I try to hush up, &ndash; viz., that I have only got one plot and produce it once a year with variations.&rdquo;",
