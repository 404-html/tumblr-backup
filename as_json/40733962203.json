Youâre always aware where your last dollar came from, where your next dollar is coming from and exactly how many dollars you (donât) have.&rdquo; :-(</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Being poor is six dollars short on the utility bill and no way to close the gap.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;Being poor is having to live with choices you didnât know you made when you were 14 years old.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>P.S. The comments go on for ever, and each is sadder than the last.</p>",
