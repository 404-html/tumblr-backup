   "quote-text" : "This, you might object, is typical philosophical hairsplitting, avoiding the main issue: should you marry Halitosis Guy, or not? But Goodin&rsquo;s argument is liberating.

Periodically, he suggests, review your balance of settling versus striving, to see if it&rsquo;s time for a change, and new year is as good a time as any to take stock. But stop worrying about whether to settle: you are settling. Mercifully, you don&rsquo;t have a choice.",
