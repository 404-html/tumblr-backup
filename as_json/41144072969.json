   "quote-text" : "<p>While faculty worry about the quality of online courses, the truth is that our education system, primarily designed to test rote memorization, is built to scale and be independent of teacher interaction. A review of research by the Department of Education in 2009 found that âstudents who took all or part of their class online performed better, on average, than those taking the same course through traditional face-to-face instruction.â</p>\n\n<p>More recently, a pilot of MIT and Harvardâs joint online educational initiative, EdX, found that blending SJSU classes with world-class online lectures reduced the number of students who received a C or lower by 31%.</p>\n\n<p>In other words, computers can â and have â successfully replaced teachers.</p>",
