Secretly, I&#8217;m hoping that I write some awesome horror story Stevenson-style, but that&#8217;s highly unlikely. Also: is horror/robots a genre? Like, &#8220;I, Robot&#8221; but scary. Presumably this was a thing at some point before Asimov&#8217;s Laws made robots &#8220;safe&#8221;, but that&#8217;s not what I mean; I mean, psychological thrillers *with* robots. Bearing in mind that I am typing this on a tiny wafer of electronics that can understand spoken direction.</p>",
