Secretly, I&rsquo;m hoping that I write some awesome horror story Stevenson-style, but that&rsquo;s highly unlikely. Also: is horror/robots a genre? Like, &ldquo;I, Robot&rdquo; but scary. Presumably this was a thing at some point before Asimov&rsquo;s Laws made robots &ldquo;safe&rdquo;, but that&rsquo;s not what I mean; I mean, psychological thrillers *with* robots. Bearing in mind that I am typing this on a tiny wafer of electronics that can understand spoken direction.</p>",
