Â While hostilities ceased, the state of war did not formally end until the Treaty of Versailles in 1919. Â And technically the United States was not a party to the Treaty of Versailles as it was never ratified by Congress, despite President Wilsonâs efforts. Â It wasnât until 1921 when the Knox-Porter Resolution would formally end the state of war between the United States and the Central Powers.</span></p> (via <a href=\"http://todaysdocument.tumblr.com/\" class=\"tumblr_blog\">todaysdocument</a>)\n\n<p>This is what happens if you try to factcheck the National Archives.</p>"
