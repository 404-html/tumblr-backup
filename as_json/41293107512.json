   "quote-text" : "I saw pictures of these young girls standing their ground getting beaten up, screaming in the cops&#8217; faces. Learned pundits question why. What is the point of this protest anyway? What do they want? It&#8217;s a pity they can&#8217;t even see this basic point. They want to be treated as humans again. I read about the rape in Delhi and the anger in me has refused to go away. Memories of those years of harassment came flooding back. If you&#8217;re a woman in Delhi, you&#8217;ve been groped and violated five times a day since you were eight. Since you were too young to even know what breasts are and what they can do to men. My years in Delhi exacted a heavy price from me. I&#8217;d instinctively step back when a man entered my personal space. This instinct finally started ebbing away after I moved to Pune. Even there, I&#8217;d instantly be on my guard, alert and tense, when a man looked over my shoulder as I worked on the laptop. This was because of Delhi and it took years for it to go away.",
