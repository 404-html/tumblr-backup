   "quote-text" : "<p>Mr Boyle says the 95-year rule applied to older works made little sense. If copyright is assigned, in keeping with the American constitution, to &#8220;promote the progress of science and useful arts&#8221;, extending it to people who had no expectation of long-term gains (and many of whom were, in fact, dead when the law was passed) would have needed to provide a retrospective incentive to create the works in the first place.</p>\n\n<p>Duke&#8217;s centre thus uses January 1st to tell Americans what they would be enjoying ready access to were the pre-1978 rules (a term of 28 years renewable in writing for another 28 years) still in place. The list includes volumes by Winston Churchill, Philip K. Dick&#8217;s &#8220;Minority Report&#8221;, Alfred Hitchcock&#8217;s 1956 remake of &#8220;The Man Who Knew Too Much&#8221; and Johnny Cash&#8217;s composition (though not recordings of) &#8220;I Walk the Line&#8221;.</p>",
