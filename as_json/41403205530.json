The year was 1956, and the creation was a landmark moment in computer graphics and cultural history that has gone unnoticed until now.</p>\n<p>Using equipment designed to guard against the apocalypse, a pin-up girl had been drawn.Â </p>\n<p>She was quite probably the first human likeness to ever appear on a computer screen.Â </p>\n<p>She glowed.Â </p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I DEMAND FANFICTION FOR THIS DIGITAL WOMAN! THE EVE OF COMPUTER GRAPHICS DESERVES AN ORIGIN STORY.</p></blockquote>\n\n<p>That&#8217;s quite the sine curve. Also: <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lenna\">Lena SÃ¶derberg</a>.</p>",
