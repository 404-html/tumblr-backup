   "quote-text" : "<p>Such manoeuvres are perfected in his fiction, with his use of the transferred epithet â a technique that casts the state of mind of the protagonist onto a nearby, often unlikely inanimate object. We have, for example, &#8220;I balanced a thoughtful lump of sugar on my teaspoon&#8221;; &#8220;he uncovered the fragrant eggs and b and I pronged a moody forkful&#8221;; or the memorable ablutions in Jeeves and the Feudal Spirit: &#8220;As I sat in the bathtub, soaping a meditative foot and singing, if I remember correctly, &#8216;Pale Hands I Loved Beside the Shalimar&#8217;, it would be deceiving my public to say that I was feeling boomps-a-daisy.&#8221;</p>\n\n<p>The shifting of affect, from mind to limb, is not only absurdly incongruous, it has the effect of holding the emotion in question at arm&#8217;s (or leg&#8217;s) length. The pace of this sentence is also ingenious. It suspends its meaning, clause after clause, building up our expectations, till it sinks, like a punctured rubber duck, on &#8220;boomps-a-daisy&#8221;. It is a phrase as unexpected â after the precision of &#8220;if I remember&#8221;, the mystique of &#8220;Shalimar&#8221; and the rhetorical nod to &#8220;my public&#8221; â as it is daft. But Bertie isn&#8217;t even feeling &#8220;boomps-a-daisy&#8221;; it is part of his charm that his low mood is described not only tangentially, captured in the shape of his &#8220;meditative&#8221; foot, but through negative inference and euphemism.</p>\n\n<p>[..]</p>\n\n<p>But Wodehouse&#8217;s pre-eminent stylistic flourish is his use of metaphor and simile: &#8220;Ice formed on the butler&#8217;s upper slopes&#8221;; a man &#8220;wilts&#8221; like &#8220;a salted snail&#8221; â and one finds the same in his letters. &#8220;Things,&#8221; he tells a friend, &#8220;are beginning to stir faintly, like the blood beginning to circulate in a frozen Alpine traveller who has met a St Bernard dog and been given a shot from the brandy flask&#8221;; returning to New York, he reflects, &#8220;was like meeting an old sweetheart and finding she has put on a lot of weight&#8221;.</p>",
