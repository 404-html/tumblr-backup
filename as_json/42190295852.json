Now look at herâsheâs such a lovely vessel for displaced sexual frustration and voyeuristic lust, just like her mother.â</p>\n<div><span>âSeems like just yesterday she was this creative 7-year-old kid, pretending her Barbie was the first woman president,â Hayes added. âMy, they grow into little more than consumer goods so quickly.â</span></div>\n<div>\n<p>Marveling at the rite of passage that all females make from girlhood into entirely disempowered objecthood, Hayes expressed confidence that the 17-year-old would one day become a highly prized physical possession for âone lucky guy.â</p>\n</div>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The Onionâs feeling <em>sassy</em> today</p>\n</blockquote>",
