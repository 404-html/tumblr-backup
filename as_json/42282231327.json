   "quote-text" : "<p>Betty Farrell, the executive director of the policy center, noted that art museums have always been odd ducks within the academic structure, which is built around departments. But, she said, they are starting to find ways both to fit into their universities and to use their neither/nor status to serve as cultural gathering places for both students and the public. &#8220;Academic disciplines are pretty strongly walled,&#8221; Ms. Farrell said, &#8220;and itâs very hard to jump across them, but it&#8217;s happening. It hasn&#8217;t happened everywhere, obviously.&#8221;</p>\n\n<p>Yale curators like to show off a place easily overlooked amid the flash and filigree of the renovation, where such walls have been breached altogether. Until a decade ago the university&#8217;s ancient coin and medal collection, one of its earliest holdings, was under the jurisdiction of the university library. It had been &#8220;basically stuffed, as it were, into a broom closet,&#8221; said William E. Metcalf, who teaches classics and is the gallery&#8217;s first curator of coins and medals. </p>\n\n<p>[..]</p>\n\n<p>\"This is the only department in which students are able to actually touch the works of art,\" Professor Metcalf said proudly, looking over his new domain. \"Of course, we want them to wash their hands first.\"</p>",
