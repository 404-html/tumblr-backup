HOMESTUCK FANDOM keeps nervously glancing at your CROWBAR.</p>\n<p>People also keep crying over HIATUSES. Please, youâre still holding out for your THIRD INSTALLMENT. In the meantime, you keep obtaining more HATS. Which is perfectly fine.</p>\n<p>You seem to have a thing in common with HOMESTUCK FANDOM. Youâll ship anything. ROBOTS and TEST SUBJECTS, a SCIENTIST and his COMPANION, even MORTAL ENEMY TEAMS. Yes, the entire teams. You ship them in every way. <em>Every way.</em></p>\n<p><br/>You think everyone just needs to calm down and wear some HATS.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Hell. Freaking. Yes.</p></blockquote>\n\n<p>*refuses to be impressed until y&#8217;all start shipping ships*</p>"
