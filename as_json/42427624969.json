   "quote-text" : "<p>In short, to anyone with dating experience, ânice guyâ sounds like âessentially lackluster, if largely unobjectionable male person.â And this is what youâre presenting as your best trait. This is what you aspire to.</p>\n\n<p>Now, I hear some of you complaining âwomen always say they want a nice guy.â I know lots of women â Iâm even related to a few â and I canât say Iâve ever heard any of them say that. I canât prove it, but this sounds like one of those things stand-up comedians say about women and everyone else just repeats. Iâve also never known a woman who cries when she breaks a nail â although Iâve known a few who swear like a 15-year-old sailor in jail â and Iâve never had a woman ask me if her outfit made her look fat unless she actually wanted and subsequently appreciated my opinion. So either Iâve stumbled upon a secret trove of women who arenât passive-aggressive sob machines, or you need to stop mistaking Dane Cook routines for peer-reviewed sociological studies.</p>\n\n<p>At any rate, if a woman does say âI just wish I could find a nice guy,â I would suggest this is the equivalent of âIâm so hungry I could eat a horse.â Which is to say, sheâs not hoping youâll say, âYouâre in luck, I have a dead horse in my backyard!â</p>\n\n<p>The Sapir-Whorf hypothesis states that the way you use language shapes your perception of the world. (This should not be confused with the Sapir-Worf hypothesis, which states that the Romulans are lying and we should raise shields.) So maybe youâd become a better person if you started by not using such a flaccid, pallid term to refer to yourself.</p>\n\n<p>Hereâs my suggestion: Instead of trying to be a nice guy, aspire to be a good man. You might be surprised at the results.</p>",
