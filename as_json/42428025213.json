It has moss growing on its back. The water around it is tinged cyan. Watermarks are at the top and bottom of the page. TEXT: âPlease donât let anger consume you. You are only hurting yourself. Do what you can, but please donât let it ruin you.â]</p>\n<p>(<a href=\"http://www.arkive.org/west-indian-manatee/trichechus-manatus/image-G1396.html\">photo credit</a>)</p>\n<p>While I think there are many things in the world I understand you are angry about - about unfairness, cruelty, people not thinking about their actions, I ask that you please donât let anger destroy you. Be angry if you must. Use that anger as passion, as fire, and use it to make the world better. But please, when you have done what you can, let go of it. Donât let that fire burn you to cinders. I like you very much, after all.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>SELF REFERNTIAL MANATEES</p>\n\n<p>IâMA GO EAT A CROISSANT</p>\n\n<p>ALSO, IT WOULD BE NICE IF THE NEW LAYOUT DIDNâT MAKE IT SO EASY TO REBLOG THINGS TO THE WRONG BLOG.<br/><br/></p>\n<p>IâVE DONE THIS LIKE THREE TIMES NOW.</p></blockquote>\n\n<p>I love that manatee can take care of you while she&rsquo;s taking care of all of us. She is basically the best is what I&rsquo;m saying. Hope you&rsquo;re feeling better/less angry!</p>",
