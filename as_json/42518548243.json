Recommended reading: Chris Sim&#8217;s fantastic <a href=\"http://www.comicsalliance.com/2011/07/29/ask-chris-66-superman-batman-and-the-worlds-finest-friendshi/\"><em>Ask Chris #66: Superman, Batman and the World&#8217;s Finest Friendship</em></a>, which has the wonderful paragraph, &#8220;Superman, the all-powerful invulnerable alien, has no reason to keep himself guarded. Nothing can physically hurt him, which leads naturally to an attitude of openness. Why wouldn&#8217;t he walk up to someone and offer his hand in friendship? They literally can&#8217;t stab him in the back. If they try, he&#8217;ll deal with them then, but has nothing to lose by assuming the best in people.&#8221;</p>",
