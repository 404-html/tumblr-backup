Recommended reading: Chris Sim&rsquo;s fantastic <a href=\"http://www.comicsalliance.com/2011/07/29/ask-chris-66-superman-batman-and-the-worlds-finest-friendshi/\"><em>Ask Chris #66: Superman, Batman and the World&rsquo;s Finest Friendship</em></a>, which has the wonderful paragraph, &ldquo;Superman, the all-powerful invulnerable alien, has no reason to keep himself guarded. Nothing can physically hurt him, which leads naturally to an attitude of openness. Why wouldn&rsquo;t he walk up to someone and offer his hand in friendship? They literally can&rsquo;t stab him in the back. If they try, he&rsquo;ll deal with them then, but has nothing to lose by assuming the best in people.&rdquo;</p>",
