   "quote-text" : "The second I read about what had happened with Aaron Swartz, the parallels made me lurch. They both snapped under accusatory pressure. They both hung themselves when they were left alone. But it was more than that. They just seemed like such similar people to me. Itâs hard for me to put my finger on exactly why I felt this way â one person I knew only as a child, the other I did not know at all. But they both seemed to possess a âtoo good for this worldâ innocence. Everyone describes Swartz exactly the way I remember my father â as a sweet person who was nice to everyone around him and just seemed to want to do good in the world.",
