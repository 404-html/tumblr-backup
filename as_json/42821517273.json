Would God still like me if Iâm gay? My best friend said thatâd heâd accept me, but he wouldnât like that one part of me that likes girls when Iâm a girl. I feel really hurt and I justâ¦I donât know. Would you still like me if I am gay? Is it okay for me to be gay?</span>]</p>\n\n<p>Oh sweetheart. Of course. Of course God will love you, completely and utterly. And I will too.</p>\n<p>You are wonderful and perfect, exactly as you are right now. It is more than okay for you to be who you are, right at this very second. And the next second, and the next, and every second until the end of time.</p>\n\n<p>It breaks my heart to think that you may feel as though you will not be loved for something as simple as who you love. Love is a wonderful thing, and I cannotÂ conceiveÂ of a God who wouldnât love you because of who you love.</p>\n\n<p>It is absolutely okay, sweetheart. Of course it is okay.<br/><br/>I love you so much.<br/><br/>xox ManateeÂ </p></blockquote>\n\n<p>Dear manatee, stop making me cry. Yours sniffily, Gaurav</p>",
