Me neither. In fact, this code was a bit confusing and in the process of understanding it, I wound up rewriting the test messages similar to this:</p>\n\n<blockquote><code>\nok 1 - If no cookies are found, we should redirect the user<br/>\nok 2 - ... to a transparent gif<br/>\nok 3 - ... and the cookie should have a value of 0<br/>\nok 4 - ... and the log should have default values and be marked as not valid\n</code></blockquote>\n\n<p>Which of those would you rather read as a maintenance programmer?</p>",
