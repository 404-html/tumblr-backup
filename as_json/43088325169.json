   "quote-text" : "When parents say, âI wish my child didnât have autism,â what theyâre really saying is, âI wish the autistic child I have did not exist, and I had a different (non-autistic) child instead.â Read that again. This is what we hear when you mourn over our existence. This is what we hear when you pray for a cure. This is what we know, when you tell us of your findest hopes and dreams for us: that your greatest wish is that one day we will cease to be, and strangers you can love will move in behind our faces."
