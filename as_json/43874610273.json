Youâre really t<span class=\"text_exposed_show\">ired, upset and frustrated. Suddenly you start experiencing severe pain in your chest that starts to drag out into your arm and up into your jaw. You are only about five miles from the hospital nearest your home. Unfortunately you donât know if youâll be able to make it that far. You have been trained in CPR, but the guy that taught the course did not tell you how to perform it on yourself..!!<br/><br/> NOW HOW TO SURVIVE A HEART ATTACK WHEN ALONEâ¦<br/><br/> Since many people are alone when they suffer a heart attack, without help, the person whose heart is beating improperly and who begins to feel faint, has only about 10 seconds left before losing consciousness.<br/><br/> However, these victims can help themselves by coughing repeatedly and very vigorously.<br/><br/> A deep breath should be taken before each cough, and the cough must be deep and prolonged, as when producing sputum from deep inside the chest.<br/><br/> A breath and a cough must be repeated about every two seconds without let-up until help arrives, or until the heart is felt to be beating normally again.<br/><br/> Deep breaths get oxygen into the lungs and coughing movements squeeze the heart and keep the blood circulating.<br/><br/> The squeezing pressure on the heart also helps it regain normal rhythm. In this way, heart attack victims can perhaps buy precious time to get themselves to a phone and dial 911.<br/><br/> Rather than sharing another joke please contribute by broadcasting this which can save a personâs life! <br/><br/> Be prepared and become part of the solution.
