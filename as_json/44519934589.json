   "quote-text" : "You donât ever have to feel guilty about removing toxic people from your life. It doesnât matter whether someone is a relative, romantic interest, employer, childhood friend, or a new acquaintance â you donât have to make room for people who cause you pain or make you feel small. Itâs one thing if a person owns up to their behavior and makes an effort to change. But if a person disregards your feelings, ignores your boundaries, and continues to treat you in a harmful way, they need to go.",
