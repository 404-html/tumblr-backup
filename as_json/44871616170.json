   "quote-text" : "The conclusion I have arrived at after two days of pondering is probably incomplete and may shift with time. Aaron Swartz is what I wish I was. I am a bright technologist, but I&#8217;ve never built anything of note. I have strong opinions about how to improve this world, but I&#8217;ve never acted to bring them to pass. I have thoughts every day that I would share with the world, but I allow my fears to convince me to keep them to myself. If I were able to stop being afraid of what the world would think of me, I could see myself making every decision that Aaron made that ultimately led to his untimely death. This upsets me immensely. I am upset that we have a justice system that would persecute me the way it did Aaron. I am upset that I have spent 27 years of my life having made no discernible difference to the world around me. Most of all I am upset that Aaron&#8217;s work here is done when there is so much more he could have accomplished.",
