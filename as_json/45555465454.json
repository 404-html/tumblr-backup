I am old-fashioned!</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Yeah, to be honest, it bugs me too!Â  But, thatâs the nature of language change.Â  :)Â  I mean, âawfulâ originally meant literally âfull of aweâ.Â  I believe it was one of the King Jameses who described a cathedral, with high praise, as âawful and artificialâ, in the meaning âfull of aweâ and âartfully-madeâ.</p></blockquote>\n\n<p>Oooh, I <em>love</em> that! I use &ldquo;awesome&rdquo; a lot, in the modern American sense of &ldquo;cool&rdquo;, but I love slipping it in in the sense of &ldquo;to [terrify/fill] with awe&rdquo;. I&rsquo;m going to try to work in &ldquo;awful&rdquo; as well, now!</p>",
