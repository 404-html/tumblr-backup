I grew up a military brat, and while I spent had a significant amount of time away from the military itself it was, quite literally, the culture and environment I had known from birth. The day I <strike>turned in</strike> <a href=\"http://dgho.st/Nd6m\" target=\"_blank\">was supposed to turn in my ID card</a> was quite literally the first time in my life when IÂ <em>didnât</em> have a military ID anymore. To be faced with transitioning not only out of military life into the civilian world, but also planning multiple transitions between schools without a clue where I would ultimately fit in or belong, was a daunting challenge.Â To resolve it, I settled on one theory that I still follow to this day:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>If you follow what is <em>truly</em>Â important to you - what you are passionate about and what you value, not just what is important in the short term - long enough and through enough adversity, youâll find yourself surrounded by people of similar beliefs and values and interests.Â </p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In general, following my own advice for once has worked out quite well. Iâve met people who have, without knowing it, validated that theory, and I have grown so much as a person compared to who I was. Whereas many people I know who got out wound up going back in, I am actually quite happy without having the military in my life because I have been working towards things that I actually care about. There is only one problem though:<strong> I still have no fucking idea what I want to do in life.</strong></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://blog.dghost.net/post/45563049988/not-all-who-wander\">Read More</a></p></blockquote>\n\n<p>I <em>love</em> that quote, it&#8217;s brilliant.</p>",
