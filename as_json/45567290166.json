Today weâre gonna talk about MENTAL DISORDERS, and the actions of NON-NEURO TYPICALS and their PERCEPTION by SOCIETY AT LARGE.</p>\n<p>Today at group therapy I shoved myself in this tight spot for a couple minutes. It was nice and tight and comfortable to me, and I KNOW I looked weird as hell but I was comfortable so idgaf.</p>\n<p>Some of the other group members, neurotypical folk, said things to newcomers like âsheâs autisticâ and âshe doesnât realize it looks weird to you, itâs her space so all we care is that she is comfortableâ</p>\n<p>While these statements were said with the best of intentions, they made me realize something that goes hand in hand with the gross generalization of all non-NTs; people think we all donât know we look weird as fuck to them.</p>\n<p>Iâm here to set your NT asses straight:<br/> Some, in fact many autistic/non-NT persons KNOW that they are âdifferentâ and that their actions might be perceived as such<br/> -society has taught me that bobbing back in forth in my chair is strange looking to others<br/> -society has taught me that piling shit on your lap when youâre laying/sitting down is considered abnormal<br/> -society has told me a lot of shit, and basically I am well aware that I look goddamn strange to you and it doesnât matter to me because Iâm comfortable</p>\n<p>Part of self care is making my self comfortable, and part of being an âallyâ means not acting like youâre so much more aware of the âabnormalâ nature of my own actions than I am</p>\n<p>Because i am quite aware that society thinks Iâm freaky<br/> I am just beyond caring<br/> Thank you.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>There is this whole assumption that I hear TIME AND AGAIN that when people are acting weirdly (especially Developmentally Disabled people)Â  that They must not know theyâre acting weird or otherwise they would act Normally.</p>\n<p>ItÂ  all comes down to the idea that everyone is essentially the same inside an that Everyone Should act âNormalâ at all times.</p>\n<p>Which is not the way the world works!Â  People are different.Â  People act differently.Â  <strong>And people have REASONS for the way they act.</strong></p>\n<p>And I know that society thinks I act weird.</p>\n<p>And I am beyond caring.</p>\n<p>And that is a Good Thing!<strong><br/></strong></p>\n<p>because it lets me get on with living my life and caring for my people.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>YES YES YES THIS.</p>\n<p>THIS IDEA THAT WEâRE WEIRD JUST BECAUSE WE DONâT NOTICE GET ON MY NERVES.</p>\n</blockquote>",
