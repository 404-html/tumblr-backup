   "quote-text" : "<p>[&hellip;] The real divide in America on gay marriage is not along party lines (though Republicans are much warier than Democrats). The widest gap involves age. As the new poll notes, a thumping 81% of Americans under 30 back gay marriage. With numbers like that, it is less that the debate has been won among the young, and more that a whole stratum of Americans cannot comprehend what there is even to argue about.</p>\n\n<p>This is at heart a question of visibility. Decades ago, a certain sort of music fan could not see for the life of them why that nice Mr Liberace had never married, let alone imagine that they might know or be related to someone gay. Now, even people in small towns have discovered that some of their sons and daughters are gay. And as Senator Portman explained when he announced his conversion, when he learned that his own, much-loved, son was gay, that changed everything.</p>",
