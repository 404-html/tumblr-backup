   "quote-text" : "Finally, Joseph Backholm complains of same-sex supporters &#8220;fram[ing] this as a vote for gay people to be happy.&#8221; Well, yes. It is a vote for gay people to have the same defining, challenging, fulfilling, frustrating, enriching, beautiful and complete marital relationships that the rest of us have. And that is a fundamental difference between same-sex marriage and abortion. Everybody loves a wedding; nobody likes an abortion. Supporters of abortion rights simply believe that safe, legal and rare is better than unsafe, illegal and rare. The better analogy for same-sex marriage is, of course, interracial marriage. Some people still don&#8217;t like it. Fine. They can marry within their own race and grumble impotently at the TV. But what they can&#8217;t do is tell anyone else who to love and who to marry. Same-sex marriage supporters frame the case as a vote for gay people to be happy because that is precisely what it is.",
