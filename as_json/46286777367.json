Sheâs really glad I like computers and programming because she says as a business person she feels like sheâs held hostage by developers. Sheâs the one that got me interested in creating my own stuff on my computer instead of just playing with stuff other people create. She tried with my brothers but they werenât interested. Â I think theyâre stupid when I get to be their age, I donât want to be stuck playing games smart people imagine and create. I want to be able to create whatever I can imagine.Â </span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><span>Rock on with your bad self.</span></p></blockquote>",
