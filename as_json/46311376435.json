   "quote-text" : "I find it really ironic how people are really panicked about how to explain gay marriage to their childrenâ¦ and these are typically religious people. They donât seem to have a problem explaining hell or Jesusâ horrific death on a cross. So if you can explain crucifixion to a small child, I think you can probably explain two people loving each other.",
