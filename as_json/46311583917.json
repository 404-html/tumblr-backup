I think you all should see this:</p>\n<p><strong>IF THERE IS EVER A TUMBLR USER WHO HAS POSTED A GOOD-BYE MESSAGE, SUICIDE NOTE, VIDEO, OR ANYTHING OF THE SORT, PLEASE FOLLOW THIS POST.</strong></p>\n<p>1. Scroll to the top of your dashboard.</p>\n<p>2. See the circular question mark icon at the top? Itâs the third one over from your home symbol. Click on that, and a screen similar to the one in the picture will come up.</p>\n<p>3. Where you can type in questions, the box with the magnifying glass at the top, type in the word âsuicide.â</p>\n<p>4. Click on the first link that shows up. It should say, âPass the URL of the blog on to us.â</p>\n<p>5. Type in the userâs URL and tell Tumblr admin that the user is contemplating suicide and has posted a message indicating that they are going through with it or will be attempting. Hit send! Tumblr administration will perform a number of actions to contact the user and take the necessary steps to prevent the suicide.</p>\n<p><strong>TUMBLR: THIS COULD SAVE A USERâS LIFE. PLEASE DO NOT IGNORE SUICIDE THREATS.</strong></p>\n<p>Reblog this to keep other users aware. Suicide isnât a joke, and neither is someoneâs life. If you didnât know this, someone else may not, either. <strong>Pass it on.</strong></p>\n<blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>why on earth doesnât this have more notes</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I actually had to do this once. She lived.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>if you scroll past this on your dash you are absolutely heartless.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</blockquote></blockquote>",
