   "quote-text" : "Depression is the most unpleasant thing I have ever experiencedâ¦ . It is that absence of being able to envisage that you will ever be cheerful again. The absence of hope. That very deadened feeling, which is so very different from feeling sad. Sad hurts but itâs a healthy feeling. It is a necessary thing to feel. Depression is very different.",
