   "quote-text" : "It is also a meditation &ndash; on &ldquo;beauty, skill, nature, feeling, tradition, sincerity&rdquo;, all now art-world anachronisms, he fears. But above all, it is a song to his medium, the wood itself, its grain, the way it answers to the blade, the conversation to be had with it. âMakingâ is the word in Mr Esterly&rsquo;s title, and it is the nub of his book. He is in love with the physicality of his art, the flowing together of hand and brain, of chisel and creativity. The idea that the artist should both master and be mastered by the medium clearly fascinates him. It is a thought he extends to every kind of making, and with it goes a deep dismay at the divorce between artist and medium inherent in conceptual art. &ldquo;How can we know the dancer from the dance?&rdquo; he quotes, from W.B. Yeats &ndash; one poet among many to whom he turns to express his sense of artistic oneness.",
