It is a thought he extends to every kind of making, and with it goes a deep dismay at the divorce between artist and medium inherent in conceptual art. &ldquo;How can we know the dancer from the dance?&rdquo; he quotes, from W.B. Yeats &ndash; one poet among many to whom he turns to express his sense of artistic oneness.",
