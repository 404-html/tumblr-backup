   "quote-text" : "No beef Stroganoff, no âbutââas if there were a surprising contrast between âworldâs best momâ and âbrilliant rocket scientistââand no âalso.â Margaret Sullivan, the Timesâs public editor, wrote on Twitter, âTo the many whoâve tweeted at me about the Yvonne Brill obituary, I sure agree.â She pointed to a Columbia Journalism Review piece that was a plea for profiles of women scientists that did something other than explore the mystery of how they could actually be women scientists, with column inches devoted to reassuring readers about the well-being of their children, rather than the robustness of their results.",
