   "quote-text" : "Rodney Hoare, a physicist who chaired the British Society for the Turin Shroud, thought the 1988 experiment was flawed in several ways: more than one part of the Shroud should have been analysed, observers should have been present throughout the sample-taking and a broader range of dating methods used. (Full disclosure: I was once taught physics by Rodney Hoare and he thought my experiments were pretty bad too.)",
