I hope to be spared as much pain as possible on the approach path. I was perfectly content before I was born, and I think of death as the same state. I am grateful for the gifts of intelligence, love, wonder and laughter. You canât say it wasnât interesting. My lifetimeâs memories are what I have brought home from the trip. I will require them for eternity no more than that little souvenir of the Eiffel Tower I brought home from Paris.</span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><span>Spoken like only those who have come to grips with their own mortality are able. Rest In Piece, Roger Ebert.</span></p></blockquote>",
