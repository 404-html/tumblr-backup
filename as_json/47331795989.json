   "quote-text" : "<p>A priest asked, <br/>\n What is Fate, Master? </p>\n\n<p> And he answered: <br/>\n It is that which gives a beast of burden its reason for existence. <br/>\n It is that which men in former times had to bear upon their backs. <br/>\n It is that which has caused nations to build by-ways from City to City upon which carts and coaches pass, and alongside which inns have come to be built to stave off Hunger, Thirst and Weariness. <br/>\n It is that which has caused great fleets of ships to ply the Seven Seas wherever the wind blows. </p>\n\n<p> And that is Fate? said the priest. </p>\n\n<p> Fate&hellip; I thought you said Freight, responded the Master.</p>\n\n<p> That&rsquo;s all right, said the priest. I wanted to know what Freight was too.</p>",
