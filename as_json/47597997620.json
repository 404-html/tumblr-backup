Weâll only open it up to a few thousand overworked, anti-social, Ivy Leaguers. Everyone else will then join since Harvard students are so cool.</li>\n<li><strong>Dropbox</strong> - we are going to build a file sharing and syncing solution when the market has a dozen of them that no one uses, supported by big companies like Microsoft. It will only do one thing well, and youâll have to move all of your content to use it.</li>\n<li><strong>Amazon </strong>- weâll sell books online, even though users are still scared to use credit cards on the web. Their shipping costs will eat up any money they save. Theyâll do it for the convenience, even though they have to wait a week for the book.</li>\n<li><strong>Virgin Atlantic</strong> - airlines are cool. Letâs start one. How hard could it be? Weâll differentiate with a funny safety video and by not being a**holes.</li>\n<li><strong>Mint </strong>- give us all of your bank, brokerage, and credit card information. Weâll give it back to you with nice fonts. To make you feel richer, weâll make them green.</li>\n<li><strong>Palantir</strong> - weâll build arcane analytics software, put the company in California, hire a bunch of new college grad engineers, many of them immigrants, hire no sales reps, and close giant deals with D.C.-based defense and intelligence agencies!</li>\n<li><strong>Craigslist</strong> - it will be ugly. It will be free. Except for the hookers.</li>\n<li><strong>iOS</strong> - a brand new operating system that doesnât run a single one of the millions of applications that have been developed for Mac OS, Windows, or Linux. Only Apple can build apps for it. It wonât have cut and paste.</li>\n<li><strong>Google</strong> - we are building the worldâs 20th search engine at a time when most of the others have been abandoned as being commoditized money losers. Weâll strip out all of the ad-supported news and portal features so you wonât be distracted from using the free search stuff.</li>\n<li><strong>Github</strong> - software engineers will pay monthly fees for the rest of their lives in order to create free software out of other free software!</li>\n<li><strong>PayPal</strong> - people will use their insecure AOL and Yahoo email addresses to pay each other real money, backed by a non-bank with a cute name run by 20-somethings.</li>\n<li><strong>Paperless Post</strong> - we are like Evite, except you pay us. All of your friends will know that you are an idiot.</li>\n<li><strong>Instagram</strong> - filters! Thatâs right, we got filters!</li>\n<li><strong>LinkedIn</strong> - how about a professional social network, aimed at busy 30- and 40-somethings. They will use it once every 5 years when they go job searching.</li>\n<li><strong>Tesla</strong> - instead of just building batteries and selling them to Detroit, we are going to build our own cars from scratch plus own the distribution network. During a recession and a cleantech backlash.</li>\n<li><strong>SpaceX</strong> - if NASA can do it, so can we! It ainât rocket science.</li>\n<li><strong>Firefox</strong> - we are going to build a better web browser, even though 90% of the worldâs computers already have a free one built in. One guy will do most of the work.</li>\n<li><strong>Twitter</strong> - it is like email, SMS, or RSS. Except it does a lot less. It will be used mostly by geeks at first, followed by Britney Spears and Charlie Sheen.</li>\n</ul></blockquote>\n\n<p>This might be the coolest entrepreneurish Tumblr post I&#8217;ve ever seen.</p>",
