When most teenagers are faced with the miserable advice of sex education (put a condom on a carrot, use a mirror to look at your bits), or the miserable version of sexuality in porn, fan fiction offers a more honest way to engage with relationships and sex.â</p>\n<p><span>Here here, Guardian.</span></p>\n<p>(via <a class=\"tumblr_blog\" href=\"http://professorspork.tumblr.com/\">professorspork</a>)<br/><img alt=\"image\" src=\"http://33.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_mdgmrrQGK71qzwj84.gif\"/></p>\n<p><span>When Disney was trying to promulgate the story that the Jonas Brothers were strict Christians who wore rings toÂ symbolise their commitment to not putting itÂ about, fan fiction sites were full of stories of girls being ravished by the band in incestuous foursomes. While Styles was made to apologise for a whispered indiscretion on The X Factor, it was vanilla to what he is whispering in teenagersâ own imaginations. <strong>Fan fiction takes power back from a PR-obsessed industry and gives the fans free rein.</strong></span></p>\n<p><img alt=\"image\" src=\"http://38.media.tumblr.com/ad72a5bb5a11b5a31f77292b87f60914/tumblr_inline_mi3vmygY9P1qz4rgp.gif\"/></p>\n<p>(via <a class=\"tumblr_blog\" href=\"http://blackmoods.tumblr.com/\">blackmoods</a>)</p>",
