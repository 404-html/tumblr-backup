The pic on the left is what I look like. Thatâs what I wear to work, going out, everywhere.Â </p>\n<p>On the right is what I would want to wear going out and hell even going for a coffee with my friends. I never do, though, because Iâm afraid.</p>\n<p>Iâm afraid of the panic attack I have everytime a guy I donât know touches me. Even if itâs on the arm and notÂ threateningÂ at all I feel so uncomfortable by unwanted physical attention I get physically ill.</p>\n<p>Iâm afraid that what happened when I once did go out in that dress might happen again: getting eye drops in my pint.</p>\n<p>What angers me the most is when girls say theyâre not feminists or that they donât need feminism. WE ALL NEED IT. We all need a world where a girl can wear whatever she wants andÂ </p>\n<p>a) not get judged for wearing it and</p>\n<p>b) doesnât have to be afraid</p>\n<p>Itâs a joke in my circle of friends that I look like a 14-year-old boy. I donât mind the joke, because itâs accurate and kind of funny to me. After reading up on feminism and all that on tumblr and following discussions and THINKING about thins stuff I realised why I feel more comfortable like that.</p>\n<p>Itâs because in the world I live in, itâs safer to be a 14-year-old boy than a 28-year-old woman.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>Itâs because in the world I live in, itâs safer to be a 14-year-old boy than a 28-year-old woman.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>",
