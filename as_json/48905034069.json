Systematists will be able to pursue their labours as at present; but they will not be incessantly haunted by the shadowy doubt whether this or that form be in essence a species. This I feel sure, and I speak after experience, will be no slight relief. <strong>The endless disputes whether or not some fifty species of British brambles are true species will cease.</strong>",
