It has fundamentally shaped the way we communicate.</p>\n<p>To celebrate the momentous occasion of 20 years ago, CERNâthe same guys behind all those experiments at the Large Hadron Colliderâhas republished <a href=\"http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/TheProject.html\">its very first website at its original URL</a>. Itâs not much to look atâbut itâs a fine reminder of just how much the web has changed in the past twenty years.</p>\n<p>In fact, the republishing of that site is part of a broader project to excavate and preserve a whole host of digital gems that remain from the inception of the web. You can go read a lot more about the project <a href=\"http://info.cern.ch/\">over on CERNâs site</a>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Happy birthday, web!</p>",
