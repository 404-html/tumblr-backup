Your brain starts digging things up that youâd thought youâd forgotten. You try to answer questions you didnât even know were still lying there. You realize how long youâve been holding on to big emotions like hurt feelings and confusion, and also specific details â like a window that always got stuck, or the way someoneâs hair curled at their collar.</p>\n<p>All of these things become colors on your palette, there for you even if youâre not consciously reaching for them â¦</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>A thoughtful, fascinating post from author Rainbow Rowell on a question sheâs been getting from many readers: Why is Park, one of the main characters in her novel <em>Eleanor &amp; Park</em>, Korean?</p>\n</blockquote>",
