Now they dictate policy at every election.</p>\n<p>In my family photo album there are pictures from the 20s of a woman called âuncle bobâ. She dressed in menâs clothing, and had a âcompanionâ. This was a rough industrial town, they were working class, nobody cared. <em>It was her business.</em></p>\n<p><em>This is why politics is important - the moment you think everything is better today than it was in the past, you let other people take control of the direction society goes in - with you sitting back presuming weâre going forwards.<br/></em></p>\n</div>\n</blockquote>\n<p>reblogging for the commentary</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Thereâs not enough love in the world.
