   "quote-text" : "If we look at [India&rsquo;s laws dealing with the age of adulthood] as individual pieces of legislations, they are terse, catering to a specific context. But when combined together to form a child protection mechanism, they contradict one another and make little sense. An individual is a major at 18. But a girl can legally marry at 18 and a boy at 21. If the girl is raped within marriage at 16 years and four months of age, there is no punishment for her &lsquo;husband&rsquo;. But the legal age for a girl to marry is 18. While outside of marriage, neither a girl nor a boy can have consensual sex before the age of 18.",
