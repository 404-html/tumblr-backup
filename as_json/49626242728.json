   "quote-text" : "<p>[Jeremy] Hardy&rsquo;s new live show could be called an extravaganza were it not for the fact that nothing happens. He comes on, talks for a while and then goes off again. He doesn&rsquo;t walk about. In fact &lsquo;show&rsquo; is a bit of an overstatement. But he does say quite a lot, most of it coherent. And he means well, which is the main thing. Still alive and able to speak for lengthy periods, this will not be so much as a one-man show as an understaffed cavalcade.</p>\n\n<p>Jeremy&rsquo;s perhaps best remembered as a younger man, but there is nothing he can do about that now. He became a stand-up comic in 1984 and will be one until he dies or wins the lottery. His live work has included Just For Laughs Montreal Comedy Festival, the Edinburgh Fringe Festival where he won the prestigious Perrier Award and numerous tours of the UK and Ireland.</p>",
