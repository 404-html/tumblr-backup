   "quote-text" : "When you watch Torchwood there is a warning at the very beginning that some scenes may offend or disturb people, so if you allow your children to sit and watch it with you thatâs your responsibility, itâs not ours anymore. We kissed, we held each other, we lay on top of each other in bedâ¦ and there were lots of complaints about that. Nobody complained that I was shot in the head four times, there were burning people in ovens, that I was stabbed by a mob of 50 people hundreds of times, and I was hanging dripping my blood in a pit. So thatâs what confuses me, because youâre not complaining about gay sex, youâre complaining about two men kissing. And itâs 2011. And people say, âWell why should we have that on television?â Because the BBC have to represent the greater public â and there are gay people out there who pay their television license. For people to complain, thatâs your prerogative â but you know what, none of them turned it off! They were just embarrassed because it put them in a position where they had to explain things to their kids or their family which probably should have been explained a long time ago.",
