   "quote-text" : "<p>At a workshop not too many years ago a newer writer began to condemn a best selling novel, pointing out all its flaws and jagged edges. I listened for a long time, nodding.</p>\n\n<p>âAll those things are true,â I said. And gave him the C.C. Finlay quote. âBut until you learn what the good parts were that excited the reader, youâre always going to be bitterly upset about what is wrong with that bestseller. Learn to spot what worked in that book, and youâll be able to move forward. And youâll be a lot less upset all the time as well.â</p>",
