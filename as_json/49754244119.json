Housenspousen? Hice-spice?â Hmm, maybe houser-spousers?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Whatâs wrong with house-spouses?Â  Spouses is the plural of spouse.</p></blockquote>\n\n<p>Yeah, I know, I&rsquo;m just being cantankerous and grumbly. I just think more people should worry about the house/houses/mouse/mice/grouse/grouse madness. I do think house spouse is a cute term and would like to see it take off.</p>",
