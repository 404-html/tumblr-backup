Because I built them with minimal technology, I had no way of tracking the Tweenbotâs progress, and so I set out on the first test with a video camera hidden in my purse. I placed the Tweenbot down on the sidewalk, and walked far enough away that I would not be observed as the Tweenbotââa smiling 10-inch tall cardboard missionaryââbumped along towards his inevitable fate.</p>\n<p>The results were unexpected. Over the course of the following months, throughout numerous missions, the Tweenbots were successful in rolling from their start point to their far-away destination assisted only by strangers. Every time the robot got caught under a park bench, ground futilely against a curb, or became trapped in a pothole, some passerby would always rescue it and send it toward its goal. Never once was a Tweenbot lost or damaged. Often, people would ignore the instructions to aim the Tweenbot in the ârightâ direction, if that direction meant sending the robot into a perilous situation. One man turned the robot back in the direction from which it had just come, saying out loud to the Tweenbot, âYou canât go that way, itâs toward the road.â</p>\n<p>The Tweenbotâs unexpected presence in the city created an unfolding narrative that spoke not simply to the vastness of city space and to the journey of a human-assisted robot, but also to the power of a simple technological object to create a complex network powered by human intelligence and asynchronous interactions. But of more interest to me, was the fact that this ad-hoc crowdsourcing was driven primarily by human empathy for an anthropomorphized object. The journey the Tweenbots take each time they are released in the city becomes a story of peopleâs willingness to engage with a creature that mirrors human characteristics of vulnerability, of being lost, and of having intention without the means of achieving its goal alone. As each encounter with a helpful pedestrian takes the robot one step closer to attaining itâs destination, the significance of our random discoveries and individual actions accumulates into a story about a vast space made small by an even smaller robot.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n<p>my heart</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>maybe itâs the fever talking but when i got to the bit about the guy saying out loud ây<span>ou canât go that way, itâs toward the roadâ i started crying.</span></p>\n<p><span>(itâs not the fever)</span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>* wibble*</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><em><strong>One man turned the robot back in the direction from which it had just come, saying out loud to the Tweenbot, âYou canât go that way, itâs toward the road.â</strong></em></p></blockquote>",
