The NROâs two leftover spy satellites also had 7.9 foot-wide mirrors. For satellites, the bigger the mirror the more detail in the photo.</p>\n<p>Where Hubble was designed to look off into space, the spy satellites were meant to look down at us. Some rough calculations by UNC-Charlotte associate professorÂ <a href=\"http://maxwell.uncc.edu/gjgbur/\">Greg Gbur</a>Â (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/drskyskull\">otherwise known as Dr Skyksull</a>) let us known that this telescope would be able to see things that are just 5 inches across.Â <a href=\"http://skullsinthestars.com/2012/06/13/how-well-can-the-government-spy-on-us-via-satellite/\">With some computer processing, you could probably pick out things on the ground that are just 2.5 inches wide</a>.Â <em>From space</em>.</p>\n<p>But, the spy agency doesnât want these satellites anymore, so they gave them to NASA. For the better part of a year,Â <a href=\"http://www.astronomynow.com/news/n1211/30nrotelescopes/#.UZOHRbWG18E\">says Astronomy Now</a>, NASA has been trying to figure out what exactly to do with these new satellites.Â Now,Â <a href=\"http://www.space.com/21064-nasa-donated-spy-telescope-mars.html\">says Space.com</a>,Â the idea is being floated that one of the satellites could be shipped to Mars.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Scientists have proposed sending one of the powerful telescopes to Mars orbit, where it could look both up and down, giving researchers great views of the Red Planetâs surface as well as targets in the outer solar system and beyond.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>From orbit around Mars, says Space.com, researchers expect the satellite would be able to take photos that capture around 3.1 inches of the Red Planet per pixel. Such high-resolution imagery could help them build maps and study the planet in unprecedented detail.</p>\n<p>But thatâs just one possible future for the NROâs leftover satellites. NASA might also use them to hunt for dark energy or search for exoplanets.Â Or use them for any one of a number of other projects. Trust us, NASA has plenty of ideas for what to do with two gigantic satellites.</p>\n</blockquote></blockquote>",
