TEXT: âYou canât change people. Sometimes you will do everything right, and it wonât help. Itâs hard to accept, but people have to want to change and you canât force that. Do what you can, but remember to take care of yourself first.â]</p>\n\n<p>[<a href=\"http://www.northwestfloridaoutdooradventure.com/2011/11/27/kayaking-with-manatees-at-three-sisters-springs-in-crystal-river-florida/\">image credit</a>]</p>\n\n<p>There are going to be people in your life who need help. And while I think you should help them as best you can, thatâs the key to it:Â <em>as best you can.Â </em>At the end of the day, youâre a person. You can provide support and love, but not change. Thatâs up to them.</p>\n\n<p>And sometimes itâs going to reach a point where you canât help anymore without hurting yourself. And when that happens, you have to step back and look after yourself too. You are your own firstÂ priority.</p></blockquote>\n\n<p>My take on this has always been that it&rsquo;s like that warning in flight safety videos to &ldquo;put your oxygen mask on before you help your neighbors&rdquo;. If you don&rsquo;t put your mask on first, you could lose consciousness before you can help anyone else. If you&rsquo;re not taking care of yourself FIRST, you&rsquo;re not going to have enough emotional strength to take care of anyone else, however important they are to you, before falling apart first. So take care of yourself first, and don&rsquo;t be afraid to ask for help.</p>",
