   "quote-text" : "<p>I read several dozen stories a year from miserable, lonely guys who insist that women wonât come near them despite the fact that they are just the nicest guys in the world.</p>\n\n<p>..Iâm asking what do you offer? Are you smart? Funny? Interesting? Talented? Ambitious? Creative? OK, now what do you do to demonstrate those attributes to the world? Donât say that youâre a nice guy â thatâs the bare minimum.</p>\n\n<p>âWell, Iâm not sexist or racist or greedy or shallow or abusive! Not like those other douchebags!â</p>\n\n<p>Iâm sorry, I know that this is hard to hear, but if all you can do is list a bunch of faults you donât have, then back the fuck away..</p>\n\n<p>..Donât complain about how girls fall for jerks; they fall for those jerks because those jerks have other things they can offer. âBut Iâm a great listener!â Are you? Because youâre willing to sit quietly in exchange for the chance to be in the proximity of a pretty girl (and spend every second imagining how soft her skin must be)? Well guess what, thereâs another guy in her life who also knows how to do that, and he can play the guitar. Saying that youâre a nice guy is like a restaurant whose only selling point is that the food doesnât make you sick. Youâre like a new movie whose title is This Movie Is in English, and its tagline is âThe actors are clearly visibleâ.</p>"
