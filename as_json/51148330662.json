To be fair, it&#8217;s not a big personal rule: the last three minutes of my dream explored what happens when you like someone who likes someone else; how do you navigate the situation that it&#8217;s probably not a good idea to hang out with someone who&#8217;s probably going to want to talk to you about this other guy who you wish you could be. I have this really complicated personal rule, a part of which says that the best move is probably to level with them, so they know the circs and why you&#8217;re suddenly being weird around them. I hate it when people are all &#8220;no no I won&#8217;t tell them I like them, it&#8217;s for their own good&#8221;, because I think it needlessly dismisses the other person; but it&#8217;s also a hard position to put someone into? But I did it once and it was mostly okay? The good news is that I&#8217;m a lot savvier about people I like and friends and managing my relationships with human beings better than I was a decade ago, so hopefully this situation are far less likely than it once was.</p>",
