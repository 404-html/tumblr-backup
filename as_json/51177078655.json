   "quote-text" : "Wikipedia is an encyclopedia and is the fifth most popular property on the web. At present, there are more than 75,000 active contributors across the globe with hundreds of thousands of volunteers at computers working on more than 13,000,000 articles in more than 260 languages. Recently, the system has become much more sophisticated and &#8220;vandals&#8221; are handled quickly. But the majority of science articles and good health information are rated by Wikipedia as &#8220;incomplete.&#8221; There is a real opportunity to strengthen this public resource. A biochemistry professor who was part of the NIH Wikipedia Academy workshop in July 2009, noted about the content: &#8220;[it is] meant to derive its authority from journal references, scientific literature &#8230; &#8221; We hope these guidelines will help you to become part of a unique opportunity in keeping with the NIHâs history of making credible, vetted, authoritative information available to the public. The time spent can be minimal, but the impact could be great.",
