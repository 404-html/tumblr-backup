And you turn on Star Trek and thereâs this Asian guy not chopping anybody up. Heâs honorable, a helmsman of a spaceship, and it was a big, big deal for me to see that and have a role model.",

That moment of seeing George Takei not being overly-stereotyped when I was a kid was a powerful one. I think the only place I had really seen other Asians on the screen was finding the rare (because I was a kid in mountains, far from the rest of the community) movie that had Asians in it. Unfortunately, a lot of those were the âwhite guy learns martial arts, beats up Asians because âMerikaâ type movies. Which, of course was not TV. They were still the âAsian otherâ just as in MASH backdrops. Anyway, what Iâm trying to say is that Sulu always has a special place in my heart. Star Trek helped me get through some bad emotional spaces as a kid, and I think part of what made it welcoming was having POC, especially George Takei ( since Iâm JA too, and the other Asian American actors who came later), represented on screen in positive and whole characters, with names instead of âSolider #1, Henchman #4, Ninja #18â.</p>\n<p>(via <a class=\"tumblr_blog\" href=\"http://reallifedocumentarian.tumblr.com/\">reallifedocumentarian</a>)</p>\n<p><strong>(Proper) representation matters.Â </strong></p>\n<p>(via <a class=\"tumblr_blog\" href=\"http://angryasiangirlsunited.tumblr.com/\">angryasiangirlsunited</a>)</p>\n<p>It makes me incandescently angry that the makers of the current trek movies donât grasp that the incredible imagination and sense of potential that gave the original series its beauty and power had literally nothing whatsoever to do with alien starship battles.Â </p>\n<p>Mae Jemison became the first black woman in space, and do you know why she joined NASA?<em> Lt Uhura.</em> Can you imagine, can you even BEGIN TO FATHOM how many scientists, doctors, teachers, artists, mechanics, diplomats, there might be out there in the world who wereÂ <span>like John Cho,</span><span>Â likeÂ </span><span>Whoopi Goldberg, who turned on their tv one day and the tv said to them YOU CAN DO THIS, YOU MATTER.Â </span></p>\n<p>Star Trekâs heart and power is that it painted a reality where people were going to go out into the universe with a sense of curiosity and unity, and where everyone was fundamentally equal. And it didnât just tell you that, it <em>showed</em> you.Â </p>\n<p>(via <a class=\"tumblr_blog\" href=\"http://sharpestrose.tumblr.com/\">sharpestrose</a>)</p>",
