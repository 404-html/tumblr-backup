Scott Fitzgerald to Ernest Hemingay. Hemingway sent Fitzgerald the typescript of âA Farewell to Armsâ, and Fitzgerald wrote back about ten pages of commentary and edits, ending his critique with a compliment about the book overall, saying âA beautiful book it is.â After reading the ten pages of criticism of his book, Hemingway added his own colorful language (pictured) on the bottom. But, we know from later drafts that he did consider some of the advice! (From the Hemingway Collection at the JFK Library)</span></p></blockquote>",
