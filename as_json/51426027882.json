   "quote-text" : "<p>As new areas are explored, the number of species naturally increases (see article). For example, the number of species of monkey, ape and lemur gradually increased until the mid-1960s, when it levelled off. In the mid-1980s, however, it started rising again. Today there are twice as many primate species as there were then. That is not because a new wave of primatologists has emerged, pith-helmeted, from the jungle with hitherto unknown specimens. It is because a lot of established subspecies have been reclassified as species.</p>\n\n<p>Perhaps &#8220;reclassified&#8221; is not quite the right word. &#8220;Rebranded&#8221; might be closer. Taxonomists do not always get it right first time, of course, and what looked like one species may rightly later be seen as two. But a suspiciously large number of the new species have turned up in the limited group of big, showy animals known somewhat disparagingly as &#8220;charismatic megafauna&#8221; &#8212; in other words the species that the public, as opposed to the experts, care about.</p>",
