That&#8217;s great! Understanding how it works mean I only melt into liquid hopelessfulness instead of just bawling like a baby.</p>\n\n<p>Reply: Full disclosure: I didn&#8217;t really get into WALL-e or Up! all that much, but I loved Ratatouille, so that&#8217;s where I stand on Pixar. I think the finale of Toy Story 3 is the second most wonderful sequence ever animated, second only to the unbeliveatude of Up!&#8217;s first ten minutes, especially considering that TS3 had all movie (and, if you&#8217;ve seen it, the entire trilogy) to set up the final ending, while Up! had two kids shouting at each other for five minutes before jumping into some of the cleanest nicest bestest storytelling I&#8217;ve ever seen. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UTBQYAE-pMk\">brb crying</a></p>",
