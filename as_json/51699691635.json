   "quote-text" : "Koenig suggests that the answer may involve interactions with birds. He and Andrew Liebhold of the US Forest Service in Morgantown, West Virginia, analysed 45 years of data from the North American Breeding Bird Survey (W. D. Koenig and A. M. Liebhold Am. Nat. 181, 145â149; 2013) and found that bird populations tend to fall during the years in which periodical cicadas emerge. Birds feed on cicadas, so Koenig expected to find the opposite pattern. He proposes that the masses of cicadas trigger long-term changes in the forest that end up causing bird populations to crash after 13 or 17 years. The mechanism remains a mystery, but Koenig notes that one factor could be the flood of dead cicadas, whose bodies are 10% nitrogen. The die-off sends a pulse of fertilizer into the forest that temporarily enhances plant growth but could later lead to unfavourable conditions for birds. &#8220;It&#8217;s a pretty weird hypothesis,&#8221; he admits.",
