We are looking for creators, hackers, educators, curators, tumblr kids and anyone else looking to play with some code and content.Â ApplicationsÂ are due June 1st.</p>\n<p>Hereâs how it works: You create a custom tumblr theme at a url we supply and post a weekâs worth of stuff from the vast depths of the Internet Archive. You can sequence, combine and remix it any way you want. Weâll be here to help you along in your exploration.</p>\n<p>When your week comes up, weâll change our theme at this url to the one you coded and reblog your weekâs worth of posts. After youâre featured, your residency will be archived at its original url.</p>\n<p>Virtual residents receive access to our staff in assisting with use of our resources and the residentâs coding, in addition to the featuring of the residentâs collaborative work. This is a project using public platforms following open source ideals and is a volunteer outreach effort for our non-profit organization. There is no residency or application fee, nor any location or identity based requirement. Any content needed for theme development will be hosted on the Archiveâs servers without cost.</p>\n<p>Interested?Â <a href=\"http://internetarchive.tumblr.com/#form\">Fill out our form</a>, let us know about you and show us a tumblr youâre proud to have made.
