Nobody wants to fall into a safety net, because it means the structure in which theyâve been living is in a state of collapse and they have no choice but to tumble downwards. However, it beats the alternative.</p>\n\n<p>7. Someone feeling wronged is like someone feeling thirsty. Don&#8217;t tell them they aren&#8217;t. Sit with them and have a drink.</p>\n\n<p>11.
