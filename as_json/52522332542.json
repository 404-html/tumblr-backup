   "quote-text" : "And a serious lack of foresight over all. Too many major decisions are quick reactions to sudden changes in the market.

It just means they&rsquo;re always late to the party, and whatever game they&rsquo;re trying to compete with has already faded away by the time their own version hits the market.",
