If some games jumps to the top of the Top Grossing charts then everyone need to drop everything and change to follow it. Which wastes time, makes for bad design and ultimately puts projects behind schedule. It just means they&#8217;re always late to the party, and whatever game they&#8217;re trying to compete with has already faded away by the time their own version hits the market.",
