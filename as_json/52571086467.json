Meet Katrina Hodge, a corporal in the British Army and Miss England 2009. According to Wikipedia, she enlisted back in 2004 after her brother challenged her to and earned the nickname âCombat Barbieâ after showing up at her assigned unit wearing false eyelashes, kitten heels (whatever those are) and carry a pink suitcase. In 2005 her unit, the Royal Anglian Regiment, was deployed to Iraq, where she saved the lives of her comrades from a prisoner by wrestling not one, but two rifles from him and then knocking his ass out with her bare hands.</p>\n<p><em>With her bare hands</em>.</p>\n<p>Then in 2009, she decided to compete in the Miss England competition to destroy stereotypes about women in the military. She didnât win (she placed runner-up), but still became Miss England after the woman who did got into a fight and gave up the crown. While Miss England, Hodge convinced the people running the competition to ditch the bikini contest, because she felt that it was more important to be a role model than looking good in a bikini.</p>\n<p>In 2010, she handed over the crown and returned to military service, being deployed to Afghanistan.</p>\n<p>This woman is both a BAMF and a HBIC. <em>Damn</em>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Over 62k notes. o_O</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>BADASS.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>FYI, these are kitten heels:</p>\n<p><img alt=\"image\" src=\"http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_memglv8hUi1rti8aw.jpg\"/></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Oh my god, this woman is AMAZING. &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3</p>\n<p>Anybody who thinks femmes are weak needs to be SCHOOLED.</p>\n</blockquote>",
