   "conversation-text" : "(Weâre taking a calculus final. The TA is a well-known Lord of the Rings fan, and weâve had running LotR jokes all semester.)\r\n\r\nTA: âOkay, guys, everyone look at me. Weâve been over the rules, but just in case: no notes, pencil your answers in on the scantron sheet, and graphing calculators only â no more âcan I just used my cell phoneâ nonsense.â\r\n\r\nStudent: â[TA's name], my calculator batteries just died! What should I do?â\r\n\r\nTA: âHere, Iâve got a big box of spares.â\r\n\r\nStudent: *struggling* âI canât get this packaging openâ¦â\r\n\r\nStudent 2: âHere, Iâve got a pocket knife.â\r\n\r\nTA: âAnd Iâve got a pair of scissors if you need them.â\r\n\r\nStudent 3: *from the back of the room* âOR MY AXE!â\r\n\r\n(Everyone starts laughing.)\r\n\r\nTA: âThe only axes allowed on the exam are in the graph section.â\r\n\r\n(Everyone groans.)\r\n\r\nTA: âOh, come on, youâre in a math class. Deal with the math jokes.â\r\n\r\n(The professor enters with a stack of exams. With him are two exam proctors.)\r\n\r\nProfessor: âTolkien jokes already, [TA's name]?â\r\n\r\nTA: âHey, I didnât start it.â\r\n\r\n(The professor starts handing stacks of exams to the TA and proctors.)\r\n\r\nProfessor: âBut Iâm about to finish it. [TA], take these exams down the left flank. [Proctor 1], follow the desks down the center. [Proctor 2], take your exams right, along the wall.â\r\n\r\n(At this point, many of the students have realized where this is going: Theodenâs lines from âReturn of the King.â)\r\n\r\nProfessor: âForth, and fear no problems! Solve! Solve, students of calculus! Points shall be taken, scores shall be splintered! A pencil day! A red-ink day! Until three thirty!â\r\n\r\n(The professor pulls out a pencil, holding it out like a sword, and runs down the first row holding it out. Students hold up their pencils, hitting his as he passes.)\r\n\r\nProfessor: âSolve now! Solve now! Solve to good grades and the class ending! MAAATH!â\r\n\r\nEntire Class: âMAAATH!â\r\n\r\nProfessor: âMAAAAATH!â\r\n\r\nEntire Class: âMAAAAAATH!â\r\n\r\nProfessor: âForth, exam-takers!â\r\n\r\n(The entire class rises to their feet and gives him a standing ovation. A week later, we get an email from the professor.)\r\n\r\nProfessor: *at the end of the email* âPS: I appreciate all of you who wrote in their evaluations that I was the one professor to rule them all, but the best one yet was the student who called me âMathrandir.ââ",
