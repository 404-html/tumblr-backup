   "quote-text" : "<p>Nasa&#8217;s ageing Opportunity rover on Mars has just made what may be one of its most significant discoveries to date. </p>\n\n<p>[..] </p>\n\n<p>It has an &#8220;arthritic&#8221; robotic arm, its solar panels are losing efficiency, and it drives backwards to save wear on its locomotion system.</p>\n\n<p>It is also now having to contend with glitchy flash memory. But the US space agency is determined to keep pushing the vehicle for as long as possible.</p>\n\n<p>\"Remember, the rover continues in a very hostile environment on Mars,\" said John Callas, Nasa&#8217;s Opportunity project manager.</p>\n\n<p>\"The rover could have a catastrophic failure at any moment. So, each day is a gift.\"</p>",
