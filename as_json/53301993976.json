   "quote-text" : "(As the final curtain slowly descends, Brick glances at Margaret, this time the look is very, very, very cool and very, very, very detached, for this is the veneer he has adopted due to years of being a repressed homosexual. Margaret, once again, looks out to the audience with her signature expression of wide-eyed, devilish enthusiasm, which is used to overly sell to theatergoers the point that she is actually quite cunning, and that her main goal has always been to inherit Big Daddy&rsquo;s fortune. Hopefully these themes of repression and greed were explored fascinatingly enough to sustain interest over a three-hour period. Also, Margaret is like a cat on a hot tin roof because she is sexually unfulfilled. Curtain. THE END.)",
