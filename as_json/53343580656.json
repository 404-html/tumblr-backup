To me, it made him feel genuinely alien, not running into danger with joy, but just genuinely unclear on how a grin isn&rsquo;t very reassuring to humans when there are, say, Daleks everywhere (I also like that unlike the Tennant Doctor, he seems to take time travel and its consequences very seriously, eh, most of the time).</p>",
