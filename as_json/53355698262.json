While this may be true for some, the truth is that people are complicated and that people are more than capable of finding meaning and forming emotional connections with just about anything. While I know a number of people who have found strong emotional ties to video games, often to specific moments, I generally think these ties wind up being held secret for fear of reprisal and for fear of external judgement. The world is kind of a shitty place so I entirely understand why people do this - if for no other reason that I am generally that person too.Â </p>\n<p><span>Fortunately, I am in a unique position of not only giving precisely zero fucks what the world thinks of me, but also having an abundance of emotional burdens that I need to give up. As a result, Iâm going to take a few moments and wax poetic about how a video game changed my life for the better, and what it means to me today.</span></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://blog.dghost.net/post/53349536527/video-games-do-matter\">Read More</a></p></blockquote>\n\n<p>Oh gosh.</p>",
