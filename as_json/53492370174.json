Furthermore, while I get that the TARDIS is only supposed to be the doorway into the episode and then it goes away (sometimes literally), I (1) wish that wasn&#8217;t so, and (2) that&#8217;s just barely fine when you have <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Satan_Pit\">a really good episode</a>, but its annoying when used too often. Of course there is the rare episode where <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Girl_in_the_Fireplace\">using the TARDIS, either for time or space travel, would just make things worse</a>, but &#8230; I don&#8217;t know. Maybe I expect too much from writers.</p>",
