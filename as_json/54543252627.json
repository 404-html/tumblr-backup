   "quote-text" : "<p>But medicine, much as some donât like to hear it, can help. I am on a regime of four a day. One is an SNRI, the other a mood-stabilizer. I havenât considered suicide in anything other than a puzzled intellectual way since this pharmaceutical regime &ldquo;kicked in&rdquo;.</p>\n\n<p>[&hellip;]</p>\n\n<p>I can be sad for <a href=\"http://stephen-fry-me.tumblr.com/post/52978628784/what-i-have-lived-for-three-passions-simple-but\">the same reason [Bertrand Russell] was</a>, though I do so much less about it than that great man did. But I can be sad for personal reasons because I am often forlorn, unhappy and lonely. These are qualities all humans suffer from and do not qualify (except in their worst extremes) as mental illnesses.</p>\n\n<p>[&hellip;]</p>\n\n<p>I can read back that last sentence and see that, bipolar or not, if Iâm under treatment and not actually depressed, what the fuck right do I have to be lonely, unhappy or forlorn? I donât have the right. But there again I donât have the right not to have those feelings. Feelings are not something to which one does or does not have rights.</p>"
