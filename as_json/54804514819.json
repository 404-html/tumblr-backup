   "quote-text" : "<p>At some point during this phase, I was crying on the kitchen floor for no reason. As was common practice during bouts of floor-crying, I was staring straight ahead at nothing in particular and feeling sort of weird about myself. Then, through the film of tears and nothingness, I spotted a tiny, shriveled piece of corn under the refrigerator. </p>\n\n<p>I don&rsquo;t claim to know why this happened, but when I saw the piece of corn, something snapped. And then that thing twisted through a few permutations of logic that I don&rsquo;t understand, and produced the most confusing bout of uncontrollable, debilitating laughter that I have ever experienced. </p>\n\n<p>I had absolutely no idea what was going on.</p>",
