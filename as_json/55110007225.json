No singing, no dancing, no long expositions about her plans, no tolerance for bumbling comedy sidekicks (she electrocutes a whole room full of minions when she finds out theyâve fucked up and spent the last few years searching for a baby), just outright malicious intent.</p>\n<p>I mean letâs take a look at her motivations compared to other popular Disney villains:<br/><br/>SCAR - Wanted to become King.Â </p>\n<p>URSULA - Wanted to rule the seas.</p>\n<p>WICKED QUEEN - Wanted to rule as the most beautiful woman in the land.</p>\n<p>JAFAR - Wanted to rule in the Sultanâs place and/or obtain ultimate power.</p>\n<p>Maleficient, by contrast, didnât want any of that. She didnât want more power. She didnât want fame. She didnât want to rule. She just wanted to raise hell. This is the woman who decided that every newborn child in the kingdom should die and that the land should be covered in darkness for one reason - SHE WASNâT INVITED TO A MOTHERFUCKING PARTY.</p>\n<p>Thatâs right, the evil bitch basically condemned an entire kingdom to die at her hands because she didnât get invited to a christening.</p>\n<p>This is not a woman with a motivation. She cannot be reasoned with. Her actions cannot be rationalized. She is evil for the fun of being evil, not because she wants something.</p>\n<p>THAT, my friends, is the ultimate villain. One who knows theyâre evil and LOVES it.Â </p>\n</blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This is amazing, like omfg</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>every one just bask</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I love maleficent for that reason. Maybe I should condemn a kingdom to darkness next time I donât get invited to a party. Will people like me then?</p>\n</blockquote>",
