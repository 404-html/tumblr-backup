Margorie was buried with a valuable ring, which her husband had been unable to remove due to swelling. This made her an even better target for body snatchers, who could cash in on both the corpse and the ring.</p>\n<p>The evening after Margorie was buried, before the soil had even settled, the grave-robbers showed up and started digging. Unable to pry the ring off the finger, they decided to cut the finger off. As soon as blood was drawn, Margorie awoke from her coma, sat straight up and screamed.</p>\n<p>The fate of the grave-robbers remains unknown. One story says the men dropped dead on the spot, while another claims they fled and never returned to their chosen profession.</p>\n<p>Margorie climbed out of the hole and made her way back to her home.</p>\n<p>Her husband John, a doctor, was at home with the children when he heard a knock at the door. He told the children, âIf your mother were still alive, Iâd swear that was her knock.â</p>\n<p>When he opened the door to find his wife standing there, dressed in her burial clothes, blood dripping from her finger but very much alive, he dropped dead to the floor. He was buried in the plot Margorie had vacated.</p>\n<p>Margorie went on to re-marry and have several children. When she did finally die, she was returned to Shankill Cemetery in Lurgan, Ireland, where her gravestone still stands. It bears the inscription âLived Once, Buried Twice.â</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>what did i just read</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The insanity that is the human anatomy.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>&ldquo;He was buried in the plot Margorie had vacated.&rdquo; HUH.</p>",
