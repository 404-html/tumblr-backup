   "photo-caption" : "<p>Did anyone else get the feeling that RTD was maybe just a little bit in love with the Doctor? I know that the show is his baby and it wouldn&rsquo;t be around without him, but it would have been nice if the Doctor didn&rsquo;t keep ending up representing perfect, utopian, non-violent wisdom. Or at least more interesting. Like this scene. It would have been a great time to discuss what death looked like when you were 906 years old and had outlived everybody you ever cared about, what the Doctor thought of human&rsquo;s meagre lifetimes, what an old man and a young Time Lord thought of their approaching deaths. But no, we just get some platitudes about how wonderful the Doctor is and how therefore he should consider maybe not dying.</p>",
