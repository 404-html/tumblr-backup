I received noticeably more distasteful looks from women than I did from men. One woman went as far as to make eye contact with me and shake her head disapprovingly. And for a brief moment I sat on my bar stool and felt embarrassed, like I had made a mistake by announcing Iâm just as good or bad as any man here. I had broken the unspoken rule and people were noticing. While drinking my scotch and feeling mildly insecure, it hit me in the heart. I was embarrassed for walking into a room wearing a shirt that establishes âI believe women* deserve equality and I fight for themâ. There is NOTHING in this statement to be ashamed of. Upon this affirmation, I suffocated my self-doubt and my evening was reborn. I complimented the head shaking woman on my way out of the bar and a look of genuine flattery with a hint of guilt washed over her face. Spread love, compassion and the concept of âno lesser personâ to all. And fight the fucking patriarchy every chance given</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Beautiful and well done. *applause*Â </p>\n</blockquote>",
