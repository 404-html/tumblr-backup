I know that the show is his baby and it wouldnât be around without him, but it would have been nice if the Doctor didnât keep ending up representing perfect, utopian, non-violent wisdom. Or at least more interesting. Like this scene. It would have been a great time to discuss what death looked like when you were 906 years old and had outlived everybody you ever cared about, what the Doctor thought of humanâs meagre lifetimes, what an old man and a young Time Lord thought of their approaching deaths. But no, we just get some platitudes about how wonderful the Doctor is and how therefore he should consider maybe not dying.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><span>Non-violent wisdom? He exterminated his own people AGAIN in the End of Time. He claims the laws of Time are his and tries to control the universe in The Waters of Mars. TenToo commits genocide on the Daleks. Journeyâs End and the End of Time together are the next great Time War where the Doctor, the greatest soldier the universe has ever seen, the Oncoming Storm, the Destroyer of Worlds, once again eliminates two entire species. Iâm sorry but whenever you killed your own mother and sent all of your people back to the void, I donât think you care how short humans live.</span><span><br/></span></p></blockquote>\n\n<p>Good point, I hadn&#8217;t thought of that! Here are <a href=\"http://www.artboiled.com/2012/the-role-of-pacifism-and-gun-violence-on-doctor-who/\">some examples of the Doctor being pacifist</a>, but as you point out, all of this is a response to both his  tremendous power and his past universicidal actions. I still think he&#8217;d care about human lifespans &#8212; he&#8217;s clearly very, very interested in humans, although it&#8217;s not necessarily clear why (and I do wish he&#8217;d meet more aliens who don&#8217;t want to annoy humans for about half an hour).</p>",
