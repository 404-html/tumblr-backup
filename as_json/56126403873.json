After reading a lot of overheated puffery about your new cook, you know what I'm craving? A little perspective. That's it. I'd like some fresh, clear, well seasoned perspective. Can you suggest a good wine to go with that? \r\nMustafa: With what, sir? \r\nAnton Ego: Perspective. Fresh out, I take it? \r\nMustafa: I am, uh ...\r\nAnton Ego: Very well. Since you're all out of perspective and no one else seems to have it in this BLOODY TOWN, I'll make you a deal. You provide the food, I'll provide the perspective, which would go nicely with a bottle of Cheval Blanc 1947. \r\nMustafa: I'm afraid ... your dinner selection? \r\nAnton Ego: [stands up angrily] Tell your chef Linguini that I want whatever he dares to serve me. Tell him to \"hit me with his best shot\".",
