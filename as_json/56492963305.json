There&rsquo;s nothing decent about smashing an angry drunk against the sidewalk who may be fine when he sobers up just because he has it coming at the time. And there&rsquo;s nothing decent about following some 17 year old until he feels threatened enough to fight you &ndash; like most 17 year olds who are filled with testosterone and devoid of practical experience might &ndash; then gunning him down when he starts kicking your ass.",
