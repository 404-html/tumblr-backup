Hey guys. Listen.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://33.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lwz8wcA6451qlb0bn.gif\"/></p>\n<p>Yes, it is, and Teloka is amazing, and let me just say, one of those secret projects Iâve been working on?</p>\n<p><em><strong>â¦is looking pret-ty good.</strong></em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>eeehehehe, this is so cool!! I did some GLaDOS voice-mods on miss Islaâs awesome voice acting. For science, of course.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This is seriously your voice as GLaDOS? Cool XD</p>\n<p>never played portal 2 but seen a walk through and it looks fun~</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Yeah, a friend of mine did the modulation, but itâs a bit of a challenge making your voice do the thing where people CAN modulate it like that. I have an <strong>immense</strong> amount of respect for Ellen McLain. Apparently she based GLaDOS off the way automated voices sound, so the process of creating GLaDOS was: A human imitating a computer that was trying to be human, the result of which was then put back through to make it sound artificial.</p>\n<p><br/>I <em><strong>highly</strong> </em>recommend the games, by the way. They arenât just two of my favorite games, but some of my favorite works of fiction period.</p></blockquote>",
