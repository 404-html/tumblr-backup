Longino says thatâs actually average among entomologists. âI do OK,&ldquo; he says, noting that some scientists have discovered thousands. But naming the newly discovered bugs is where you can really have fun. Longino recalls his graduate student â a self-described âmetal head&rdquo; â encouraging him to be creative.</p>\n\n<p>ââJack, Jack, you oughta name these things, like, after demons,â&quot; the student exhorted. âSo Zipacna was one of these Mayan lords of the underworld, and there was this word in the dictionary that was Mabuya, that was a demon, and so I named one <em><a href=\"http://www.antweb.org/specimen.do?name=casent0630049\">Eurhopalothrix mabuya</a></em>, which I think just sounds great.&ldquo;</p>",
