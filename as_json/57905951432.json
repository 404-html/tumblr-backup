   "photo-caption" : "<blockquote>\n<p><small><em>I am reduced to a thing that wants Virginia. I composed a beautiful letter to you in the sleepless nightmare hours of the night, and it has all gone: I just miss you, in a quite simple desperate human way. You, with all your un-dumb letters, would never write so elementary a phrase as that; perhaps you wouldnât even feel it. And yet I believe youâll be sensible of a little gap. But youâd clothe it in so exquisite a phrase that it would lose a little of its reality. Whereas with me it is quite stark: I miss you even more than I could have believed; and I was prepared to miss you a good deal. So this letter is just really a squeal of pain. It is incredible how essential to me you have become. I suppose you are accustomed to people saying these things. Damn you, spoilt creature; I shanât make you love me any the more by giving myself away like this âBut oh my dear, I canât be clever and stand-offish with you: I love you too much for that. Too truly. You have no idea how stand-offish I can be with people I donât love. I have brought it to a fine art. But you have broken down my defences. And I donât really resent it.<strong> - Vita Sackville West to Virginia Woolf </strong></em></small></p>\n<p><small><em>Look here Vita â throw over your man, and weâll go to Hampton Court and dine on the river together and walk in the garden in the moonlight and come home late and have a bottle of wine and get tipsy, and Iâll tell you all the things I have in my head, millions, myriads â They wonât stir by day, only by dark on the river. Think of that. Throw over your man, I say, and come.-<strong><strong>-Virginia Woolf to Vita Sackville West</strong></strong></em></small></p>\n</blockquote>",
