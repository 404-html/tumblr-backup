Everyone finds his creepy-ass tactics as cute and âboys will be boysâ esque. So yeah, he is terrifying.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Yeah, the truly scary thing about <em>Beauty and the Beast</em> isnât that Gaston exists, but that society fucking loves him. People who deride the movie by saying itâs about Stockholm Syndrome are ignoring that itâs actually about the various ways that truly decent people get othered by society. People donât trust the Beast because of the way he looks, which only feeds his anger issues and pushes him further away. Gaston isnât the only one who criticizes Belle for being bookish, either; the whole town says there must be something wrong with her. And her father gets carted off to a mental asylum for being just a little eccentric.</p>\n<p>Howard Ashman, who collaborated on the filmâs score and had a huge influence on the movieâs story and themes, was a gay man who died of AIDS shortly after work on the film was completed. If you watch the film with that in mind, the message of it becomes clear. Gaston demonstrates that bullies are rewarded and beloved by society as long as they possess a certain set of characteristics, while nice people who donât are ostracized. The love story between Belle and the Beast is about them finding solace in each other after society rejects them <em>both</em>.</p>\n<p>Notice how the Beast reacts when the whole town comes for him. Heâs not angry, heâs <em>sad</em>. Heâs tired. And he almost gives up because he has nothing to live for. But then he sees that Belle has come back for him, and suddenly he <em>does</em>. In the original fairy tale, the Beast asks Belle to marry him every night, and the spell is broken when she accepts. In the Disney movie, he waits for her to love him, because he cannot love himself. Thatâs how badly being ostracized from society and told that youâre a monster all your life can fuck with your head and make you stop seeing yourself as human.</p>\n<p>Society rewards the bullies because weâve been brought up to believe that their victims donât belong. That if someone doesnât fit in, then they have to be put in their place, or destroyed. And this movie demonstrates that this line of thinking is <em>wrong</em>. Itâs so much deeper than a standard âbe yourselfâ message, and thatâs why itâs one of my favorite Disney movies.</p>\n</blockquote>",
