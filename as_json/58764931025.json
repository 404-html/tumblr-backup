   "quote-text" : "<p>Iâm calm. Iâm polite. I think of the (then) recently deceased Amadou Diallo, and curb my genetic tendency towards sarcasm. The officers check my identification and make sure there are no warrants for my arrest. After itâs been determined that my story checks out, I ask the officer closest to me why I was stopped. He tells me that I âmatched the description of a suspect,â and as he answers, he notices me taking note of his badge number.</p>\n\n<p>Without explanation, Iâm handcuffed, unceremoniously stuffed into the back of a police car, and taken to Central Booking, otherwise known as âthe Tombs.â I descend a staircase deeper than the pits of Avernus and am placed into a holding cell. Itâs unclear if I am being arrested; in fact Iâm never told whatâs going on. Thereâs a phone but itâs out of order. Four hours go by. Iâm surrounded by genuinely dangerous people, who for reasons beyond my comprehension, are leaving me completely alone.</p>\n\n<p>Eight hours pass. By now Iâve missed work. Twelve hours after I drop my car off at my mechanic, an officer comes down with a stack of papers and begins to call off names. Iâm being released; apparently no charges were filed against me. My property and my freedom are returned. I receive no explanation and no apology.</p>\n\n<p>This is not the most racist thing thatâs ever happened to me.</p>",
