But there are MuggleBorn wizards, ones who, until they were eleven, lived in the real world and learned science and things. Did they all just abandon that normal, muggle knowledge, like Harry did? Itâs always been there, itching in the back of my mind.</p>\n<p>FOUR FOR YOU SCIENCE WIZARD</p>\n<p>YOU GO SCIENCE WIZARD</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>can we point out that heâs doing wandless magic too</p>\n<p>like voldemort couldnt even do that shit</p>\n<p>molly fuckin weasley couldnt fuckin do that</p>\n<p><em>who are you</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Quick, somebody write a book series about the adventures of Magic Prodigy Science Wizard!!!</p>\n<p><em><strong>PLEASE SOMEONE JUST DO IT</strong></em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Alan Baker had no use for wands, of course. If one were to</span><span class=\"s2\">Â </span><em>Prior Incantato</em>Â his outdated, duct-taped rod of walnut wood and dragon heartstring, its most recent use would have been the enchantment of the long-lived neurons in Alanâs own mind. This enchantment, possible only for those who were capable of seeing themselves as a complex amalgamation of neural impulses, allowed him to bypass both wands and words. Alan did this, not for show, not for power, but because wandwork distracted him from his reading.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Unfortunately, there was no legal spell to get rid of barflies.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">âHey- hey mate, you gotta- gotta minute to-â</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><em>Sobrius</em>, Alan thought, placing one hand on his neighborâs forehead without looking up. He pondered whether or not to cast a silencing barrier, even in violation of the Leaky Cauldronâs safety code.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">âThanks,â said the now-sober man, âReadinâ more of that Muggle trash, I see.â</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Alan closed his eyes and counted to three, but when he opened them, the man was still there. Alan lowered his âmuggle trashâ in defeat, meeting the baggy, bloodshot eyes of the wizard sitting across from him.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Alan leaned forward, placing his hands steeple-like on the table. âMr. Fletcher, do you know why time turners donât send you into space?â</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">âThe sky, yâmean? Cause theyâre fer time turninâ, not apparation.â</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Alan had to take a deep breath. âNo,â he replied, âIf time turners werenât anchored to anything, the Earthâs rotation alone would be enough to ensure a time travelerâs demise. But someone at the ministry was clever enough to anchor them to a carefully guarded object that never moves relative to the Earth.â</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">âFascinatân,â slurred Mundungus, whose eyes had glazed over once it became clear that Alan didnât actually have a time turner on him.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">âBut time turners are still very limited,â continued Alan, more to himself than to Mundungus, âThey canât go more than seven hours back, and not forward at all, and only in increments of one hour, and they only work on Earthâ¦ no, theyâre very clumsy, if one truly pauses to think about it.â</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">âWhatâs yer point?â</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">âMyÂ <em>pointÂ </em>is that while wizards are slowly stagnating in their backwards remnant of the Dark Ages, Muggles are making progress, ever reaching for the light. Do you know that they donât need magic to craft a hand of living silver?â</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">âBah,â was Mundungusâs only reply, âYouâd be best mates with that Weasley nutcase at the ministry, you would.â</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Alan stood up, silently casting anÂ <em>infantes gelataÂ </em>to check for paradoxes. âI donât know why I bother with you,â he sighed, âyouâve just wasted another two minutes of my time. Perhaps I bother because I have time to waste.â</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">And he twisted, as if to apparate, but instead faded out of existence with a distinctÂ <em>vworp</em>. The air swirled in the wake of his departure, blowing back Mundungusâs straggly ginger hair.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">âMuggleborns,â the short wizard muttered, then turned back to his drink.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">â¢â¢â¢â¢â¢â¢â¢â¢</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Thirty minutes earlier, Alan lounged contentedly within his quieting barrier, stirring his cup of tea absently and rereading one of his favourite Muggle books. He wondered, vaguely, which planet held the nearest sapient life, and what their magic would look likeâ¦</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This rereading, however, would be slightly shorter than the last. Even within the barrier, the presence of another at the table tickled at Alanâs consciousness. He set down his book (rather forcefully, he had to admit,) and looked up. The bloodshot eyes of Mundungus Fletcher didnât meet him when his own rose.</p>\n<p>âHello,â mouthed the man. <em>Finite Incantatum,</em> thought Alan.</p>\n<p>âHello,â he answered, âCan I help you?â</p>\n<p>âNo, not really. Well, maybe. Well, probably. Have you seen anything strange lately? Disappearing cats, people moving backwards, variances in the time vortex causing precise and intentional reversal of the course of events?â</p>\n<p>Alan couldnât help but stare. âErâ¦now that you mention it, I was justâ¦â he trailed off as he glanced out the window and did a double take. There was a 1960s-style Muggle police telephone box in the middle of Diagon Alley. ââ¦Isâ¦is that a telephone box?â</p>\n<p>âNo. Yes. Recreation. Mock-up. Donât worry, nobody will notice,â the man said, waving his hand dismissively even as he pulled on a pair of what appeared to be cheap 3-D glasses. âWhat I want to know,â he murmured conspiratorially, âis whatâs giving you that floaty, aurary, bizarrey stuff all over you, because that should not be happening to a human. Person. I said personâ</p>\n<p>Alanâs eyebrows furrowed. âFirst of all, this is Diagon Alley. Most people out there wouldnât know a police box from a pillbox, especially given itâs bright blue. Second of all, those glasses shouldnât give you the ability to see what youâre seeing. And thirdly,Â <em>Expelliarmus.</em>â</p>\n<p>âExpelliwhat?â the man squawked, just as a long, chunky metallic object with a blue tip shot out of his jacket pocket and into Alanâs hand. A quick Identification spell told him all he needed to know.</p>\n<p>âFuzzy logic neural interface configured for ease of use, limited nonverbal manipulation of mechanical and electronic objectsâ¦Interesting. And leaps and bounds beyond anything wizards or Muggles can conjure up. What are you?â</p>\n<p>The man stared at him for a few minutes before breaking out in a wide smile. âHello. Iâm the Doctor. Let me tell you a little bit about the universeâ¦â</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>(thank you for expanding on that, captainexposition)</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://sites.google.com/site/shermansplanet/storage/Something%20Very%20Special.pdf\">MORE SCIENCE WIZARD FIC HERE.</a></p>\n<p>I will be posting regular updates if this seems like something that people will enjoy.</p></blockquote>",
