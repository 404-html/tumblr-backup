Alkebulan is the oldest and the only one of indigenous origin. It was used by the Moors, Nubians, Numidians, Khart-Haddans (Carthagenians), and Ethiopians. Africa, the current misnomer adopted by almost everyone today , was given to this continent by the ancient Greeks and Romans. &rdquo;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Yes the continent got its name after Scipio Africanusâ¦some ole white man from Greece/Rome. A lot of black historians donât even like calling it Africa because of that fact.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Africanus was anÂ <em>agnomen</em>, a name bestowed upon a person in honor of some great accomplishment.Â  His birth name was Publius Cornelius Scipio, to which <em>Africanus</em> was bestowed by the Senate.Â  It was given to him in honor of a military victory in the Second Punic War, which took place in Africa.Â  In other words, Scipio Africanus was named after Africa, not the other way around.Â  The name Africa in turn is derived from a particular people, the Afri, which name was used for the province of Africa, which covered only a small stretch of northern Africa, around the former city of Carthage after it was conquered by Rome:</p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/51/REmpire-Africa.png\"/></p>\n<p>Later, that name was extended to the entire continent, just as the name Asia originally referred to a particular Roman province in what is now western Turkey (hence the modern term âAsia minorâ)</p></blockquote>",
