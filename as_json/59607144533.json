   "quote-text" : "<p>&ldquo;The Garden faced a shortfall that could not be fully addressed by increasing revenue targets or reducing non-personnel costs.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>The publicly-funded Garden&rsquo;s mission statement highlights research among its top priorities, along with displaying plants for the enjoyment of the wider community and providing educational programs for children and adults.</p>\n\n<p>On its 2012 tax return â the most recent one available â the garden lists scholarly research as a &ldquo;significant use of its collection items,&rdquo; and goes on to detail the &ldquo;1,280 rare books, ephemera and manuscripts&rdquo; at the heart of that endeavor. </p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;The collection furthers the organization&rsquo;s exempt purpose as it supports our mission to engage in research in plant sciences to expand human knowledge of plants, and disseminating the results to science professionals and the general public.&rdquo; </p>\n\n<p>Preserving New York&rsquo;s botanic treasures has long been the Garden&rsquo;s raison d'etre. But without the science department, whose staffers painstakingly collected, cataloged, and in some cases hand-raised the rare seeds of the new Native Flora expansion, ex-employees say the institution risks becoming just another walled garden for the area&rsquo;s expanding upper crust.</p>",
