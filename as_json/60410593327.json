   "quote-text" : "Wanna be a writer? Find a different way to say &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to the store&rdquo; every single time you say it. Come up with nicknames for all of your friends. Ask people questions, welcome conversation from an outside perspective, do not drop a topic until you are satisfied. For every different room in which you find yourself on every single day, point out at least one thing that is there, but shouldn&rsquo;t be there, and why it shouldn&rsquo;t be there. Then take maybe ten minutes a week to get it down on the page. Writing only takes a long time when the only time you think about writing is when you are writing."
