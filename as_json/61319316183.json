I know, ick. But I trudge through. It helps that the first line of my dating profile is âIâm a feminist,â and the second line is, âI donât believe in casual sex, so I would have to go on at least 10 dates with you before Iâd sleep with you.â This effectively filters out all the creepo pervs, but one guy got very angry about the supposed âcontradictionâ in those statements, and wrote me:</p>\n<p><span>&ldquo;You canât call yourself a feminist and not believe in casual sex. Feminism is casual sex, you canât have one without the other. Look it up!&rdquo;</span></p>\n<p>&ldquo;Where should I look it up?&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;You know - those books where women have sex like men. Thatâs feminism!&rdquo;</p>\n<p><span>&ldquo;What about the right to vote, equal pay for equal work, pro choice, etc?&rdquo;</span></p>\n<p>&ldquo;Thatâs not feminism. Thatâs just uppity female bullshit. But you still wonât tell me how you reconcile feminism with causal sex&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Nope. And I wonât. Because my sex life is none of your business&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Bitch! You are so blocked!&rdquo;</p>\n<p>How this man ever gets a date with anyone is beyond me.Â </p></blockquote>",
