Itâs part design class, part museum studies course, and part SCIENCE class! Youâll get to come to the Museum every Thursday for an academic year, get to know employees and staff and researchers here at The Field, hang out with me once in a while, and get class credit so I donât even know why you havenât applied yet.</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://fieldmuseum.org/happening/youth-design-team-academic-course\" title=\"The Field Museum: Youth Design Program\">Applications are due Friday</a>. I wish I would have heard about this before then because I would have shouted it from the mountain tops weeks ago but SERIOUSLY APPLY.</strong> Iâm jealous I canât take it so you need to take it for me.Â </p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>FYI, to any followers in Chicago!</p></blockquote>",
