   "quote-text" : "1. Iâm lonely so I do lonely things<br/>\nâ¨2. Loving you was like going to war; I never came back the same.â¨<br/>\n3. You hate women, just like your father and his father, so it runs in your blood.â¨<br/>\n4. I was wandering the derelict car park of your heart looking for a ride home.â¨<br/>\n5. Youâre a ghost town Iâm too patriotic to leave.â¨<br/>\n6. I stay because youâre the beginning of the dream I want to remember.â¨<br/>\n7. I didnât call him back because he likes his girls voiceless.â¨<br/>\n8. Itâs not that he wants to be a liar; itâs just that he doesnât know the truth.â¨<br/>\n9. I couldnât love you, you were a small war.â¨<br/>\n10. We covered the smell of loss with jokes.â¨<br/>\n11. I didnât want to fail at love like our parents.â¨<br/>\n12. You made the nomad in me build a house and stay.â¨<br/>\n13. Iâm not a dog.â¨<br/>\n14. We were trying to prove our blood wrong.â¨<br/>\n15. I was still lonely so I did even lonelier things.â¨<br/>\n16. Yes, Iâm insecure, but so was my mother and her mother.â¨<br/>\n17. No, he loves me he just makes me cry a lot.â¨<br/>\n18. He knows all of my secrets and still wants to kiss me.â¨<br/>\n19. You were too cruel to love for a long time.â¨<br/>\n20. It just didnât work out.â¨<br/>\n21. My dad walked out one afternoon and never came back.â¨<br/>\n22. I canât sleep because I can still taste him in my mouth.â¨<br/>\n23. I cut him out at the root, he was my favorite tree, rotting, threatening the foundations of my home.<br/>\nâ¨24. The women in my family die waiting.â¨<br/>\n25. Because I didnât want to die waiting for you.â¨<br/>\n26. I had to leave, I felt lonely when he held me.â¨<br/>\n27. Youâre the song I rewind until I know all the words and I feel sick.â¨<br/>\n28. He sent me a text that said âI love you so bad.â<br/>\nâ¨29. His heart wasnât as beautiful as his smileâ¨<br/>\n30. We emotionally manipulated one another until we thought it was love. â¨<br/>\n31. Forgive me, I was lonely so I chose you. â¨<br/>\n32. Iâm a lover without a lover. â¨<br/>\n33. Iâm lovely and lonely. â¨<br/>\n34. I belong deeply to myself .",
