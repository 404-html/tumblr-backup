(We considered just linking back to our list of <strong><a href=\"http://classicpenguin.tumblr.com/post/27635419765/classic-smut-while-it-seems-as-though-fifty\" title=\"Penguin Classics Smut\">classic literary smut</a>Â </strong>and being done with it, but that seemed all too easy.) So below, check out a few historically hackles-raising PenguinÂ Classics that came to mind around the office. And never forget that reading classics can be rebellious.Â </p>\n<hr><p><strong><em><a href=\"http://us.penguingroup.com/nf/Book/BookDisplay/0,,9780142000663,00.html?strSrchSql=The+Grapes+of+Wrath+centennial/The_Grapes_of_Wrath_John_Steinbeck\" title=\"The Grapes of Wrath\">The Grapes of Wrath</a></em>Â by John Steinbeck</strong><br/> John Steinbeckâs legendary depiction of Americans struggling for survival during the Great Depression has been burned, banned, and the topic of numerous censorship trials since its publication in 1939. Though the bookâs purpose was to illuminate the plight of migrant families, many authorities felt theyâd been depicted in an unfair light. The battles over censoring <em>The Grapes of Wrath</em> have been international, including a Turkish trial in which publishers faced up to six months imprisonment for âspreading propaganda unfavorable to the state.â<br/><br/><strong><em><a href=\"http://us.penguingroup.com/nf/Book/BookDisplay/0,,9780140186420,00.html?Of_Mice_and_Men_John_Steinbeck\" title=\"Of Mice and Men\">Of Mice and Men</a></em>Â by John Steinbeck</strong><br/>No stranger to ruffled feathers, John Steinbeckâs 1937 novelÂ <em>Of Mice and Men</em>Â has managed to amass quite an interesting list of enemies. Along with plenty of school curriculum battles,Â <em>Of Mice and Men</em>Â was banned in Ireland in 1953 and condemned by a South Carolina chapter of the Klu Klux Klan. Censorship battles over the novel continue even today.Â <br/><br/><strong><em><a href=\"http://us.penguingroup.com/nf/Book/BookDisplay/0,,9780140439120,00.html?On_the_Origin_of_Species_Charles_Darwin\" title=\"On The Origin of Species\">On The Origin of Species</a></em>Â by Charles Darwin</strong><br/>Among the most controversial works of modern time, Charles Darwinâs revolutionary work in the natural sciences has been banned on numerous occasions. Dramatized in the 1955 play âInherent the Windâ, Darwinâs theory of evolution was banned from Tennessee schools for 42 years after the infamous Scopes Trial. And the work continues to be an inflammatory topic in many parts of the world, including the United States.Â <br/><br/><strong><a href=\"http://us.penguingroup.com/nf/Book/BookDisplay/0,,9780143039587,00.html?The_Jungle_Upton_Sinclair\" title=\"The Jungle\"><em>The Jungle</em></a>Â by Upton Sinclair</strong><br/>A title synonymous with investigative journalism, Upton Sinclair turned the meatpacking industry of the early 1900s on its head with his seminal workÂ <em>The Jungle</em>, in which he exposed the mistreatment of immigrant workers and blatant disregard of consumer health. Surprisingly, <em>The Jungle</em> was never suppressed in the United States, but was banned in Yugoslavia and burned by both the Nazis in 1933 and East German communists in 1956.Â <br/><br/><strong><em><a href=\"http://us.penguingroup.com/nf/Book/BookDisplay/0,,9780141192468,00.html?strSrchSql=Alice%C2%92s+Adventures+in+Wonderland+coralie/Alice'#39;s_Adventures_in_Wonderland_and_Through_the_Looking_Glass_Lewis_Carroll\" title=\"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland\">Aliceâs Adventures in Wonderland</a></em>Â by Lewis Carroll</strong><br/> It should come as no surprise to anyone familiar with the psychedelic fantasy depicted in Lewis CarrollâsÂ <em>Aliceâs Adventures in Wonderland</em>Â that many parents have found it a questionable story for children, despite its popularity. However, the bookâs oddest opponent surfaced in China, when in 1931 a provincial governor was wildly concerned about the effects of animals being depicted speaking human language, describing it as âdisastrous.âÂ <br/><br/><strong><em><a href=\"http://us.penguingroup.com/nf/Book/BookDisplay/0,,9780670023233,00.html?One_Flew_Over_the_Cuckoo's_Nest_Ken_Kesey\" title=\"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest\">One Flew Over the Cuckooâs Nest</a></em> by Ken Kesey</strong><br/>Ken Keseyâs <em>One Flew Over the Cuckooâs Nest</em> was making waves in public school districts throughout the country when it first published in 1962. The story of rebellious Randle Patrick Murray as he butts heads with the powerful and manipulative Nurse Ratched in an Oregon mental hospital displayed aÂ scathing critique of institutionalism and the prominent psychology of the time. Fearing the impact the book might have on their children, parents in Colorado attempted to ban the novel from public schools, claiming it âglorifies criminal activity, [and] has a tendency to corrupt juveniles.â In 1986, the book was banned from curricula in Aberdeen, Washington, simply because of its secular humanistic values.<br/><br/><strong><em><a href=\"http://us.penguingroup.com/nf/Book/BookDisplay/0,,9780143105039,00.html?Frankenstein_Mary_Shelley\" title=\"Frankenstein\">Frankenstein</a></em>Â by Mary Shelley</strong><br/>As a cautionary tale of science and manâs role in the creation of life, Mary ShelleyâsÂ <em>Frankenstein</em>Â has for the past two centuries found itself at the center of debates overÂ religion and science, its work with these themes resulting in protest from many various Christian groups. Though never governmentally censored in the United States, South Africa banned the novel in 1955 for obscenity.Â <br/><br/><strong><em><a href=\"http://us.penguingroup.com/nf/Book/BookDisplay/0,,9780140283334,00.html?strSrchSql=The+Lord+of+the+Flies+great+books/Lord_of_the_Flies_William_Golding\" title=\"The Lord of the Flies\">The Lord of the Flies</a></em>Â by William Golding</strong><br/>William Goldingâs 1954 novel <em>The Lord of the Flies</em> has been in the censorship cross-hairs of American parents for decades. Those attempting to ban the book have done so on the grounds that it is excessively violent, racist, and âimplies that man is little more than an animal.â But Golding, a schoolteacher himself, wrote the book in response to an 1858 novel by R. M. Ballantyne, <em>The</em><em>Coral Island</em>, in which a group of young boys stranded on a desert island get along quite swimmingly. Though Golding enjoyed the book, his experience with schoolchildren led him to take the morality of the situation inâ¦a different direction.Â <br/><br/><strong><em><a href=\"http://us.penguingroup.com/nf/Book/BookDisplay/0,,9780143105947,00.html?The_Adventures_of_Huckleberry_Finn_Mark_Twain\" title=\"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn\">Adventures of Huckleberry Finn</a></em>Â by Mark Twain</strong><br/>When is a word just a word, and when is it something more? Considered the Great American Novel by many, Mark Twainâs use of racially loaded slurs in his novel <em>Adventures of Huckleberry Finn</em> has been the topic of dozens of censorship battles. A disparaging picture of the antebellum South, Twainâs tale of a young man barreling down the Mississippi with an escaped slave has been among the most polarizing works of literature. First published in 1885, the novel has sparked heated debate over the publication and wider cultural effects of racist slurs. Though many cite context and Twainâs aim of revealing Southern racism as justification of the slangâs use, many advocates of censoring the work have called for select slurs to be replaced with simply âThe N-Word.â <br/><br/><strong><em><a href=\"http://us.penguingroup.com/nf/Book/BookDisplay/0,,9780143106470,00.html?Black_Beauty_Anna_Sewell\" title=\"Black Beauty\">Black Beauty</a></em>Â by Anna Sewell</strong><br/>Possibly the most unusual banning of a book on our list, Anna Sewellâs <em>Black Beauty</em> was prohibited in Apartheid South Africa based on a misunderstanding. Though Anna Sewellâs novel champions compassion for all living things, its title was misinterpreted by the white National Party as a novel about a black woman and hence deemed not fit for the public. Naturally, the officials were far too busy to actually read the literature considered unacceptable.</p>\n<hr><p>Classic Fridays | <em>The world is full of classics.
