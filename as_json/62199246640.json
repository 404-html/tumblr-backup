On facebook, on tumblr, from my coworkers, in the newspaper.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;The government wouldnât do that.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>I have seen this in response to allowing massive changes that will destroy our environment, scrapping what little environmental protection we have, outlawing basic healthcare needs for women, taking away protections from workers, taking rights away from the marginilised, etc.<br/><br/>&ldquo;The government wouldnât do that.&rdquo;<br/><br/>Hereâs the thing: They would. They can. They have.Â </p>\n\n<p>And what scares me more than what they have done and what they have yet to do, but what scares me more is that some people arenât scared at all.</p></blockquote>"
