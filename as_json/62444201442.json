The species escaped earlier detection due to its similarity to other tapaculos, its elusive nature, and the remoteness of its habitat. Hosner and colleagues eventually distinguished the species, which is black in color and similar to a wren, by its unique call.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;We found the Junin Tapaculo in the field by its distinctive voice,&rdquo; Hosner said in a statement. âTapaculos are extremely difficult to identify, so at this point we werenât sure if it was a new species, or if we just happened to record a rarely given vocalization by an already described species.&ldquo; Subsequent scouring of archives and a DNA test revealed it to be a new species.</p>\n<p>The Junin Tapaculo is found in the Department of Junin in central Peru. It occupies areas of dense vegetation in Andean cloud forests at an elevation of 8,000 and 10,500 feet.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</blockquote>",
