This was a comfort to their father, a loving but busy man who, flying six times per day to the Ministry and back, would not have had the wherewithal to tell them apart if they had been. And also to their cousins, who knew that this made it harder for the girls to prank them. And also to their grandparents, who would have felt a twinge of unhappiness at discovering two more children who could exchange identities as easily as they exchanged jumpers.</p>\n<p>But their favorite Uncle would always pretend that they were.</p>\n<p>\"So itâs Lolly and Moosy again,\" he would say, shaking his head, \"Can never tell you apart.\"</p>\n<p>And although everyone older than the girls knew this was actually a very sad joke to tell, like all stupid family jokes it was only meant to comfort Molly and Lucy, and it did. It was something special and shared between them and Uncle George. To have someone who loved you enough to joke with you and play silly games and give you a rather nonsensical nickname â that meant something.</p>\n<p>(photo submitted by <a href=\"http://retrousse.tumblr.com\">retrousse</a>)</p>\n</blockquote>",
