   "quote-text" : "Scientific myths are harmful. They distort the history and the process of science by portraying researchers as extraordinary people making epic advances in a fast, linear fashion. Such tales are particularly damaging to the public&rsquo;s and to students&rsquo; understanding of the pace and complexity of science. For example, the Fleming myth ignores the vast time, effort and extra data that are required to make a medically viable drug. And by crediting luminaries with fictional achievements, we create superheroes that no student can hope to match.",
