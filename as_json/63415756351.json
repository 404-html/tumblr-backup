He was created from the idea that ânon-destructive devianceâ would go over well with kids.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>THANK YOU!</p>\n<p>Basically, the point of Oscar the Grouch is so that kids know itâs okay to haveÂ <em>fucking emotions and moods that arenât all cheery</em>. Thatâs the fucking point. And thatâs even more important to the kids who are living in harsh realities. Realities where their families are falling apart or theyâre not getting food every day or theyâre getting abused. Telling them itâs okay to express that they are NOT HAPPY because they are HURTING is so fucking important I cannot even say it.Â </p>\n<p>Big Bird is nice, but goddamn, when youâre a kid whoâs hungry and you just got beat by your caretaker and all you wanna do is hole up somewhere and tell everyone else to go away because you donât even have words for how bad things feel? Big Bird is not your dude. Cheery happy, âwell, letâs play a happy game!â Big Bird ainât cutting it for you. Oscar the Grouch is your dude. Oscar the Grouch is the dude who tells you itâs okay to put the lid on your garbage can and be alone and be upset.</p>\n<p>Big Bird tries to talk you out of being upset (and maybe sometimes thatâs okay). But Oscar the Grouch teaches you that, no, itâs <em>okay</em> to be upset and you have every right to stay upset and grouchy and unhappy until youâre at a point where that can change. Oscar the Grouch teaches you that you have a right to your emotions, whatever they are.</p>\n<p>On a more advanced level, the point of Oscar is to start teaching kids that itâs okay to have boundaries, itâs okay to want to just go into your trash can (home/safe place) and not be bothered, itâs okay to defend those boundaries and say âgo away!â when you want people toÂ <em>go the fuck away</em> and that you can still have a place on Sesame Street. That not everyone has to be shiny, happy Big Bird.Â </p>\n<p>Thatâs the point of Oscar the Grouch.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>&ldquo;what is the point of oscar the grouch&rdquo; <em>who even made you</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Also Oscar the Grouch *likes* things that no one else likes and heâs completely unapologetic about it.Â </p>\n<p>The fact that people tell you things you like are stupid doesnât make itâs true. He loves trash. He loves it because itâs trash. Thatâs important too.</p>\n<p>As is the fact that *even though everyone thinks his interests are stupid*, people donât take his trash away and they donât drag him out of his can.</p>\n<p>Also he has *fantastic* body language. Boundary laden but also very emotional. And just the way he likes stuff and expresses interestâ¦</p>\n<p>â¦Oscar the Grouch = awesome.</p>\n</blockquote>",
