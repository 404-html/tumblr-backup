   "photo-caption" : "<p><a class=\"tumblr_blog\" href=\"http://misterracoon.tumblr.com/post/63735477876/hollywood-s-race-problem-is-worse-than-you-think\">misterracoon</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><a class=\"tumblr_blog\" href=\"http://yasboogie.tumblr.com/post/63655470171\">yasboogie</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>HollywoodÃ¢ÂÂs Ã¢ÂÂRace ProblemÃ¢ÂÂ Is Worse Than You Think</strong></p>\n<p>In bleak situations, incremental improvements can be mistaken for big time progress. So it goes with HollywoodÃ¢ÂÂs consistent inability to include actors of color.</p>\n<p>Popular critical consensus suggests that we may have as many as four black Best Actor nominees: Chiwetel Ejiofor (Ã¢ÂÂ12 Years a SlaveÃ¢ÂÂ), Idris Elba (Ã¢ÂÂMandela: Long Walk to FreedomÃ¢ÂÂ), Forest Whitaker (Ã¢ÂÂLee DanielsÃ¢ÂÂ The ButlerÃ¢ÂÂ) and Michael B. Jordan (Ã¢ÂÂFruitvale StationÃ¢ÂÂ). Ejiofor is currently favored to win the category, where heÃ¢ÂÂll probably be joined by the likes of Tom Hanks (Ã¢ÂÂCaptain PhillipsÃ¢ÂÂ), Robert Redford (Ã¢ÂÂAll Is LostÃ¢ÂÂ) and Bruce Dern (Ã¢ÂÂNebraskaÃ¢ÂÂ).</p>\n<p>That these men of color are even being discussed in awards blogger circles is certainly cause for celebration, because each of their films presents a perspective that doesnÃ¢ÂÂt get much play in Hollywood. But insofar as these four movies are important, they are also limited by their veracity. TheyÃ¢ÂÂre all based on true stories: Ã¢ÂÂ12 YearsÃ¢ÂÂ tells the tale of Solomon Northup, a free black man who was captured and enslaved and wrote an autobiography by the same name; Ã¢ÂÂMandelaÃ¢ÂÂ is self-explanatory; Ã¢ÂÂFruitvale StationÃ¢ÂÂ centers on the 2009 shooting death of Oscar Grant III, a black man shot dead by a police officer in Oakland; Ã¢ÂÂThe ButlerÃ¢ÂÂ draws its meat from the life of Eugene Allen, a black butler who worked for the White House for over three decades.</p>\n<p>Put another way, these roles <em>have to</em> be played by black actors. Each of these men has more than earned the nominations theyÃ¢ÂÂre expected to receive (nowÃ¢ÂÂs a good time to pinch in some salt: awards bloggers love to shower performances with praise, but nominations are certainly not guaranteed), but the fact that theyÃ¢ÂÂre generally only rewarded for roles that literally could not have been given to white actors is cause for concern.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Generally only rewarded for roles that literally could not have been given to white actors&rdquo; is not casual phrasing. A study of the roles that have earned black men Best Actor nominations reveals that this is a historical problem. Sidney Poitier won in 1963 for playing a black itinerant worker in &ldquo;Lilies of the Field,&rdquo; a movie based on a novel by the same name. Jamie Foxx won in 2004 for playing Ray Charles in &ldquo;Ray,&rdquo; and Forest Whitaker won in 2006 for playing Idi Amin in &ldquo;The Last King of Scotland.&rdquo; The only black man to win Best Actor for a role that <em>could</em> have been played by a white actor is Denzel Washington, who won in 2001 for his turn as a LAPD detective in Ã¢ÂÂTraining Day.Ã¢ÂÂ</p>\n<p>ThatÃ¢ÂÂs one man over 85 years of Academy Awards. The situation isnÃ¢ÂÂt much better at the Golden Globes, where Morgan FreemanÃ¢ÂÂs performance as a chauffeur who triumphs over racism in Ã¢ÂÂDriving Miss DaisyÃ¢ÂÂ joins the otherwise identical list of Best Actor winners. (Nor, itÃ¢ÂÂs worth noting, does the picture improve when including Best Actor <em>nominees</em> at the Oscars, a class that includes blacks playing Ã¢ÂÂblack rolesÃ¢ÂÂ such as Will Smith in Ã¢ÂÂAli,Ã¢ÂÂ Don Cheadle in Ã¢ÂÂHotel Rwanda,Ã¢ÂÂ Terrence Howard in Ã¢ÂÂHustle &amp; Flow,Ã¢ÂÂ Freeman in Ã¢ÂÂInvictus,Ã¢ÂÂ Washington in Ã¢ÂÂMalcom X,Ã¢ÂÂ Laurence Fishburne in Ã¢ÂÂWhatÃ¢ÂÂs Love Got to Do With It,Ã¢ÂÂ etc.)</p>\n<p>Jordan has discussed enjoying filming Ã¢ÂÂChronicle,Ã¢ÂÂ which he <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/07/10/michael-b-jordan-fruitvale-station_n_3570502.html\" target=\"_hplink\">describes as a win because the character was originally supposed to be a white Jewish man</a>. Ã¢ÂÂ[With] the lack thereof of quality roles for African-American actors, I look for stuff like that,Ã¢ÂÂ he said in an interview with HuffPost Entertainment. Ã¢ÂÂI want the script that Ben Affleck or Leonardo DiCaprio couldnÃ¢ÂÂt do because of scheduling. I want that one. I want those types of roles.Ã¢ÂÂ</p>\n<p>Hollywood is even worse at including women of color in award-winning performances, (Halle Berry is the <em>only</em> black woman to ever win the Oscar for Best Actress, in a Ã¢ÂÂMonsterÃ¢ÂÂs BallÃ¢ÂÂ role with a complex and controversial relationship with race), and this yearÃ¢ÂÂs Emmys <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/09/26/diversity-gap-emmys_n_3998242.html\" target=\"_hplink\">were a shockingly white-male affair</a>. Ã¢ÂÂ12 Years,Ã¢ÂÂ Ã¢ÂÂThe Butler,Ã¢ÂÂ Ã¢ÂÂFruitvaleÃ¢ÂÂ and Ã¢ÂÂMandelaÃ¢ÂÂ all cleared an extra hurdle: they are are all independently financed films that were created without the interest or fiscal support of the major movie studios.</p>\n<p>True equality in the Best Actor race doesnÃ¢ÂÂt mean only rewarding black men in roles white men could never play. Instead, weÃ¢ÂÂll know when Hollywood casting directors and the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences view people of color as deserving of equal opportunities to shine when a black man in the role of a fictional caring father, son, teacher, student, doctor, author or otherwise non-racially coded character is nominated for and wins Best Actor.</p>\n<div>Until then, however, letÃ¢ÂÂs raise a glass to this yearÃ¢ÂÂs class of outstanding performers, because maybe, just maybe their success in this yearÃ¢ÂÂs awards rat race will jostle the shamefully whitewashed powers that be within the industry. Forgive me for not getting my hopes up</div>\n</blockquote>\n<p>real talk.</p>\n</blockquote>",
