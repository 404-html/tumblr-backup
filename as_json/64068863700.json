Extend the sequester!&rdquo;<br/>\nThen Cruz crashed a barricade, abreast of Queen Esther,</p>\n\n<p>&lsquo;Neath banners bespeaking the hot patriotism<br/>\nof those wed to statesâ rights, sequester and schism,</p>\n\n<p>Proudly proclaiming that those most inveterate<br/>\nTo defund Obamacare were, in fact, confederate.</p>"
