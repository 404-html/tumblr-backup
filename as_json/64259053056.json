Itâs not just about getting the right source so people can follow the trail, although thatâs important too; if you source correctly, the research will get more funding and youâll see more of it.</p>\n<p>In the UK, weâre currently doing the Research Excellence Framework, or REF. Departments in institutions have to write a hefty report on all the research theyâve done over the past five years. Part of that is an impact statement which includes impact on the public. Not much market-ready technology comes out of blue-skies research like astronomy. But astronomy is great at one thing - inspiration.</p>\n<p>If you source the images and research you use correctly by citing the authors and year (e.g. Smith et al. 2013) and even including a link to the paper, scientists can find where theyâve been cited in places like tumblr and record comments. We need to show that our research and our effort in publicising it has encouraged people to take up science/physics/astronomy in some way, whether thatâs as a hobby, in school or a career path. The holy grail of comments would be, for example âWow, that looks and sounds so exciting, I want to be an astronomer now!â</p>\n<p>If users donât cite in the first post, we canât find these comments for the REF, our impact is under-estimated, weâre ranked poorly and we lose funding. Simple as. So please, please help us!</p>\n</blockquote>",
