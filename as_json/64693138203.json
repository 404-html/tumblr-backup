   "quote-text" : "<p>Archbishop James Usher (1580-1656) published Annales Veteris et Novi Testaments in 1654, which suggested that the Heaven and the Earth were created in 4004Â B.C. One of his aides took the calculation further, and was able to announce triumphantly that the Earth was created on Sunday the 21st of October, 4004Â B.C., at exactly 9:00Â A.M., because God liked to get work done early in the morning while he was feeling fresh.</p>\n\n<p>This too was incorrect. By almost a quarter of an hour.</p>\n\n<p>The whole business with the fossilized dinosaur skeletons was a joke the paleontologists havenât seen yet.</p>\n\n<p>This proves two things:</p>\n\n<p>Firstly, that God moves in extremely mysterious, not to say, circuitous ways. God does not play dice with the universe; He plays an ineffable game of His own devising, which might be compared, from the perspective of any of the other players, [ie., everybody.] to being involved in an obscure and complex version of poker in a pitch-dark room, with blank cards, for infinite stakes, with a Dealer who wonât tell you the rules, and who smiles all the time.</p>\n\n<p>Secondly, the Earthâs a Libra.</p>",
