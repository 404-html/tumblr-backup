Do you feel like lying on the floor, even now, and just becoming a Remembering Thing. That&rsquo;s all I want to be sometimes. It&rsquo;s all I can be sometimes. I just remember. I look back, at the love, and the fragility, and the ease, and the rightness of life then, and that&rsquo;s all I am. A Remembering Thing.</p>\n\n<p>But it&rsquo;s impossible to be that way for long. Life calls you on; and life is good. You&rsquo;re lying on the floor, and you notice that pound coin in the dust under the piano, and you fish it out. And you&rsquo;re living again.</p>\n\n<p>But there are still times now when I look with gratitude at my life, and I want to say, This is all very nice, This is all very lovely, I thank you all, I love you all. This is all very wonderful. But it isn&rsquo;t home. It isn&rsquo;t home.</p>",
