This is a great shame, as it is a terrifying number and would be particularly suitable for a Halloween episode of The Simpsons.</p>\n\n<p>It is known as Belphegor&#8217;s prime. It is a prime number because nothing will divide into it except one and the number itself, and it is named after Belphegor (one of the seven princes of hell) because it has 666 at its heart and 13 zeroes either side of the number of the beast.</p>",
