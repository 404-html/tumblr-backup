   "quote-text" : "Donât talk to yourself in such a way that if you did so to a friend, it would end your friendship.\n<p>If you had a friend dealing with the same things, you wouldnât berate that person, say, âYouâre not working hard enough,â âYou suck,â or âYouâre not as good as [whomever].â Youâd offer your friend encouragement, youâd try to point out all the things your friend did right, and how much progress your friend had made.</p>\n\n<p>You should do no less for yourself.</p>\n\nBe very careful how you talk to yourself. Because <em>you are listening.</em>",
