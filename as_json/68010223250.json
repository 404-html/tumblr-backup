Whatâs on these tapes? Well, about 35 years of local and national news, recorded byÂ Marion Stokes, a woman who spent nearly half her life recording the news in the belief that someday it would be useful. It probably isnât very useful, <a href=\"http://www.fastcompany.com/3022022/the-incredible-story-of-marion-stokes-who-single-handedly-taped-35-years-of-tv-news?nid=3022022\">but it was a pretty epic hobby</a>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>These tapes will actually be incredibly useful. They contain hours of history that can be re-lived, instead of re-imagined, when viewed.Â </p>\n<p>The San Francisco-based Internet Archive plans to digitize the tapes and make them available on their website for searching and viewing. Someday, in the not-too-distant future, youâll be able to watch ABC News segments on the Iran hostage crisis â the event that launched Nightline. The live CNN video on the Challenger disaster. Little Jessica being rescued from the well. Nightly news segments on the fall of the Berlin wall.</p>\n<p>The first Gulf War. The war in Bosnia. TWA 800. Clintonâs impeachment. The Florida âhanging chadâ scandal. Hours of videotape on the September 11, 2001 terrorist attack. The entire war in Iraq as it played out on cable news. The start â and end â of the housing crisis that crippled economy. The election of the first black president.</p>\n<p>Marion Stokes might have had an unusual hobby, but her hobby bore a priceless gift that now millions connected to the internet will be able to enjoy. I guess Iâd expect nothing less from someone who was once a former librarian.</p>\n</blockquote>",
