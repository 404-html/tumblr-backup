Then it closed down. Then I worked in another factory and that closed too. After so long in jobs where I donât have to talk to people, I now work in a shop and have to talk to people every day. It was not easy at first, but Iâm learning! Sure Iâve had some problems but itâs OK. Show me a person who does not have problems. Everyone has them. Whatâs important is to find time to enjoy life. I love to karaoke. I love to dance. Itâs simple but it makes me happy.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>",
