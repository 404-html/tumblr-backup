It has been losing energy by radiating heat and experiences much turbulence which drains the energy of the spotâs winds. So why has it survived for so long?</p>\n<p><span>Pedram Hassanzadeh who is a postdoctoral fellow at Harvard University andÂ </span><span>Philip Marcus, a professor of fluid dynamics at the University ofÂ </span><span>California</span><span>Â have built their own model to try and explain why, andÂ according to their research, the secret lies in the vertical motion of the Red Spot:Â <em>â</em></span><em><span>As the vortex loses energy, the vertical flow transports hot gases from above and cold gases from below the vortex toward its center, restoring part of its lost energy.âÂ </span></em><span>(phys.org, 13th Nov 2013)</span></p>\n<p><span>Both scientists are aware that their model is not complete and cannot completely explain the life of the spot however <em>&ldquo;t</em></span><em><span>hey believe the occasional absorption of smaller vortices, consistent with observation, may provide the extra energyÂ </span><span>needed for hundreds of years of life. They have begun modifying their computer model to test this thesis.â </span></em><span>(phys.org, 13th Nov 2013)</span></p>\n\n<p><span>Read the full article <a href=\"http://phys.org/news/2013-11-jupiter-mysterious-great-red.html\">here</a> on the phys.org website</span></p></blockquote>\n\n<p>And then one day it&rsquo;s just going to vanish and confuse everybody.</p>",
