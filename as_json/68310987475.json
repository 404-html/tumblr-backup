   "quote-text" : "A man who assisted in autopsies in a big urban hospital, starting in the mid-1950s, describes the many deaths from botched abortions that he saw. âThe deaths stopped overnight in 1973.â He never saw another in the 18 years before he retired. âThat,â he says, âought to tell people something about keeping abortion legal.â"
