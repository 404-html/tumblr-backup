   "regular-body" : "<p>At 2:31am, trying to pull my thoughts together on my thesis dissertation proposal. My example species is <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Branta_hutchinsii\"><em>Branta hutchinsii</em> (Richardson, 1832)</a>, and maybe it&#8217;s just the 2am talking, but &#8230; 1832. <em>1832</em>. The thing I am studying goes back past the invention of the personal computer, past the breakdown of colonialism, past two world wars, past <em>The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock</em>, past the World&#8217;s Columbian Exposition, past the formation of the American Ornithologists&#8217; Union, past the foundation of the University of Colorado (and, indeed, the great state of Colorado), past the American Civil War, past <em>On the Origin of Species</em>, past the Sepoy Mutiny, past <em>The Count of Monte Cristo</em>, even past the <em>A Christmas Carol</em>. In 1832, Lewis Carroll and Gustave Eiffel were born; Johann Wolfgang von Goethe and Georges Cuvier died; Audubon was 47, Rafinesque was 49, and my life is too perfect to imagine. And today it is now December.</p>",
