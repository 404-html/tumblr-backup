He was a friend of the family - a colleague of my mother who she let stay on weekends because he was not local - he didnât have a home in Singapore. The first time it happened, he had already been staying with us for a year. We trusted him.</p>\n\n<p>Initially, I tried to fight him off but he overpowered me. Then he made threats. He said if I didnât do what he wanted - or if I told - he would hurt me and my family. I was very scared. I didnât tell anyone.</p>\n\n\n<p><a href=\"http://thepeopleofsingapore.tumblr.com/post/68764536018/azura\">Read More</a></p></blockquote>",
