   "quote-text" : "Forgive. Forget. Fake it. Chin up. Wear lipstick, make lists, make sure your voicemail isnât full. Mix protein shakes, send timely thank you notes, sip drinks more slowly, stare at adultsâ eyebrows, smile without dimples, develop perfect posture. Be gracious, be kind, eliminate self-pity. Look in the mirror and shift your internal monologue from âHow do I look?â to âThis is my face,â from âWhat the hell am I doing?â to âThis is my life.â Capitalize your emails, read the news, walk briskly, stay focused, and never, ever let on that you are somewhat lost and sometimes lonely and so completely confused (and would someone please just let me know what it is Iâm supposed to do next, where exactly Iâm supposed to goâ). Just keep going. Go, and do not stop.",
