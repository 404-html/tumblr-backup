Now, the classic form of tragedy, um, is one in which somebody who is an otherwise esteemable person stamped with the mark of one defect. That defect is played upon by circumstances and brings about his or her downfall. Now, it might just be that, uh, Macbeth for instance doesnât actually get to fight that particular battle, doesnât get to meet those particular witches and lives a perfectly ordinary life as a sort of, as a perfectly comfortable thane. Suddenly, out of nowhere, this appalling nemesis comes and hits him at the end; Macduff suddenly leaps out and kills him, and theyâve no idea why! He has absolutely no idea why. But in fact he is exactly the same person who in a different version earnt that nemesis, earnt that repercussion. And, um, he is that person, the flaw didnât actually get played upon in that particular version of reality, but the flaw was still there. And in the multi-dimensional person that he is, is that flaw that has earnt that repercussion.",
