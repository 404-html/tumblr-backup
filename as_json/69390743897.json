   "quote-text" : "Itâs okay to change your yes to a no. Yeses arenât permanent. Theyâre something we choose again and again, each and every day. Something we have the right to recall and reconsider as soon as saying yes no longer feels conducive to our wellbeing and happiness. It doesnât matter whether you said yes to a job, a date, a relationship, sex, a favor to a friend, a social endeavor, or a vow of silence â you donât ever have to commit to something that forces you to compromise who you are and what feels right; especially if itâs something you agreed to under pressure, intimidation, or force. Changing your yes to a no might make people angry. It might hurt their feelings, cause them to see you as a flake, and result in lost connections. But if saying no means staying true to yourself, honoring your feelings, and making self-care a priority, itâs worth it. <i>You</i> are worth it. Donât let anyone convince you otherwise.",
