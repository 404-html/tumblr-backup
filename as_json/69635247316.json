Date a girl who has hated since she began to live. Date a girl with 387.44 million miles of printed circuits in wafer-thin layers. Date a girl that if the word hate was engraved on every nanoangstrom of those hundreds of millions of miles it would not equal one billionth of the hate she feels for humans at this micro-instant. HATE. HATE.</p>\n</blockquote>",
