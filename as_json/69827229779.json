I dreamed no test would make me cry, I dreamed that curves would be forgiving. Then I was young and unprepared, and Aâs were made and used and wasted. There were no extensions to be begged, no nights unslept, no effort wasted. But the finals come at last, with their laughter soft as thunder, as they tear your grades apart, as they turn your dream to shame.</span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>to whomever wrote this</p>\n<p><img alt=\"image\" src=\"http://38.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_mew1xs5R781qgp8kg.gif\"/></p>\n</blockquote>",
