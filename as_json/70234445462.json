Iâm not going to tell you that youâre wrong for feeling that way, but I believe in you. If you believe in me, too, we can support each other where we need it the most. And maybe someday youâll see in yourself what I see in you.\"</span></p>\n<p><span>And thinking about that makes me tear up, not gonna lie.</span></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Also: &#8220;kamina&#8221; means something like &#8220;bastard&#8221; in Hindi and &#8220;lagaan&#8221; means taxes. #nowyouknow #sorry #boredatairport</p>",
