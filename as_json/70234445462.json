Iâm not going to tell you that youâre wrong for feeling that way, but I believe in you. If you believe in me, too, we can support each other where we need it the most. And maybe someday youâll see in yourself what I see in you.&rdquo;</span></p>\n<p><span>And thinking about that makes me tear up, not gonna lie.</span></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Also: &ldquo;kamina&rdquo; means something like &ldquo;bastard&rdquo; in Hindi and &ldquo;lagaan&rdquo; means taxes. #nowyouknow #sorry #boredatairport</p>",
