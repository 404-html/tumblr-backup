Everyone was chillinâ out, maxinâ, relaxinâ, all coolâat least until a doctorâs office employee called a 19-year-old high school student to confirm an appointment. When the employee heard the studentâs outgoing voicemail message, she became convinced the guy was up to no goodâthatÂ <a href=\"http://www.wpxi.com/news/news/local/mistaken-lyrics-fresh-prince-bel-aire-theme-song-p/nWdZq/\">he might even start making trouble in the neighborhood</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Police said a worker calling to confirm a doctorâs appointment with an Ambridge High School student heard the theme song to the âFresh Prince of Bel-Airâ when she attempted to call. The worker said she called police when she misheard the lyrics â which she claimed said âshooting people outside of school.â</p>\n<p>The actual lyrics to the song say âshooting some b-ball outside of school.â</p>\n<p>The call to 911 forced the entire district into lockdown for about 30 minutes and police said they detained the 19-year-old student for three hours while searching his locker, before determining that it was all one big misunderstanding.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Oops! Yo, homes, smell ya later!</p>\n<p>Stay fresh, Pittsburgh.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>âwere they white?â âmy mom</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I heard about this on Facebook.</p>\n<p>I justâ¦</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>â¦I donât know whether to laugh or facepalm.</p>\n<p>FUCKING MONDEGREENS, MAN</p>\n</blockquote>",
