   "quote-text" : "Target confirmed Thursday morning that it was investigating a security breach involving stolen credit card and debit card information for 40 million of its retail customers. Targetâs announcement came one day after a security blogger, Brian Krebs, first reported the breach. In a statement, Target confirmed that criminals gained access to its customer information on Nov. 27 â the day before Thanksgiving and just ahead of one of the busiest shopping days of the year â and maintained access through Dec. 15. Target said it had confirmed that its online customers were not affected by the breach, which appears to have been isolated to the point-of-sale systems in Targetâs retail stores. Target said that cybercriminals had accessed customer names, credit or debit card numbers, expiration dates and three-digit security codes for 40 million customers who had shopped at its stores.",
