   "regular-body" : "<p>What a fantastic year 2013 has been. It started with me hanging out with some awesome people, then leaving them behind as I rushed off to Durham, North Carolina. That was great, although the real highlight of that part of my life was my week long trip to Phylotastic II, which was fantastically useful, incredibly well organized, and easily the most fun I&rsquo;ve had at any conference/workshop ever. Five months, one mug, a successful third semester exam and one too many caterpillars in the face later, I was back in beautiful Boulder, Colorado. Then followed seven months of several kinds of awesomeness: going for a walk by a lake, presenting in the gorgeous <a href=\"http://palmerhousehiltonhotel.com/\">Palmer House Hilton</a>, eating <a href=\"https://foursquare.com/v/jarlings-custard-cup/4b91ae19f964a5206ccf33e3\">custard at Jarlingâs Custard Cup</a>, sprinting across the terminals to just barely make a transfer at Chicago O'Hare, and movie after movie after movie after movie. And there was a neat symmetry in which it ended kind of like it started. If 2014 is anything like 2013 for me, I&rsquo;m going to be pleased as punch. Happy new year, everybody.</p>"
