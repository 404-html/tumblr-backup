   "quote-text" : "Because thatâs the thing about Scooby-Doo: The bad guys in every episode arenât monsters, theyâre liars.<br/>\n    I canât imagine how scandalized those critics who were relieved to have something that was mild enough to not excite their kids wouldâve been if theyâd stopped for a second and realized what was actually going on. The very first rule of Scooby-Doo, the single premise that sits at the heart of their adventures, is that the world is full of grown-ups who lie to kids, and that itâs up to those kids to figure out what those lies are and call them on it, even if there are other adults who believe those lies with every fiber of their being. And the way that you win isnât through supernatural powers, or even through fighting. The way that you win is by doing the most dangerous thing that any person being lied to by someone in power can do: You think.",
