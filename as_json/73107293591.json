I had just gotten my wisdom teeth out. I remember that, because I was on a lot of painkillers, and I kept thinking that maybe my cloudy brain just wasnâÂt comprehending what I was reading on an anonymous message board created for law students, called AutoAdmit. There were hundreds of threads about me, with comments including: âOfficial Jill Filipovic RAPE threadâ âI want to brutally rape that Jill slutâ âIâm 98% sure that she should be rapedâ âthat nose ring is fucking money, rape her immediatelyâÂ âÂwhat a useless guttertrash whore, I hope that someone uses my pink, fleshy-textured cylindrical body to violate herâ âÂshe deserves a brutal rapingâ âÂLegal liability from posting pic of Jill fucking?â âsheâÂs a normal-sized girl that Iâd bang violently, maybe youâd have to kill her afterwardsâ</div>\n</blockquote>\n<p>A really disturbing read, but itâs important.</p>\n</blockquote>",
