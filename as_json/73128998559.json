   "quote-text" : "Another time a (drunken) woman of impressive size decided to pick a fight with a wooden door. I&rsquo;m not sure what you&rsquo;re picturing in your head, but it isn&rsquo;t ridiculous enough. She trash talked the door. Punched the door. Tried to scratch it with her fingernails. Kicked it in the shins. She fought dirty, as far as door fighting went. She felt the door was keeping her out, which is kind of the point of doors, but didn&rsquo;t realize that the door she was fighting wasn&rsquo;t actually her door. Some terrified person was inside that door, afraid that whoever was outside screaming and pounding might make it inside to them.",
