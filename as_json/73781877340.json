And they made all kinds of sandwiches with smashed avocado and sprouts and stuff like that. And they really tasted good. And when you were having a bad day, I remember a particularly rough movie, you&rsquo;d get sandwiches from this place. And they were very filling and very tasty, and then you&rsquo;d forget about the morning.",
