Â One will run a finger down the index of who you are and jump straight to the parts of you that peak their interest. Â The other will take his or her time reading through every one of your chapters and maybe fold corners of you that inspired them most. Â You will meet these two people; it is a given. Â It is the third that youâll never see coming. Â That one person who not only finishes your sentences, but keeps the book.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>love this quote</p>\n</blockquote>",
