   "quote-text" : "<p>Languages animate objects by giving them names, making them noticeable when we might not otherwise be aware of them. Tuvan has a word <i>iy</i> (pronounced like the letter <i>e</i>), which indicates the short side of a hill. </p>\n\n<p>I had never noticed that hills had a short side. But once I learned the word, I began to study the contours of hills, trying to identify the <i>iy</i>. It turns out that hills are asymmetrical, never perfectly conical, and indeed one of their sides tends to be steeper and shorter than the others.</p>\n\n<p>If you are riding a horse, carrying firewood, or herding goats on foot, this is a highly salient concept. You never want to mount a hill from the <i>iy</i> side, as it takes more energy to ascend, and an <i>iy</i> descent is more treacherous as well. Once you know about the <i>iy</i>, you see it in every hill and identify it automatically, directing your horse, sheep, or footsteps accordingly. </p>\n\n<p>This is a perfect example of how language adapts to local environment, by packaging knowledge into ecologically relevant bits. Once you know that there <i>is</i> an <i>iy</i>, you donât really have to be told to notice it or avoid it. You just do. The language has taught you useful information in a covert fashion, without explicit instruction.</p>",
