   "quote-text" : "[University of California, Berkeley, neuroscientist Robert] Knight has now convinced the Nature Publishing Group (NPG) to launch an online research journal called <a href=\"http://kids.frontiersin.org/\"><em>Frontiers for Young Minds</em></a> which is not only geared toward kids, but edited by them. [&#8230;] More than a dozen articles have already been published and, Knight says, &#8220;not one scientist has complained about something the kids wanted to fix.&#8221; That&#8217;s in spite of some pretty tough criticism. &#8220;I can see that it shows something about how the brain works,&#8221; wrote one uncompromising young editor, &#8220;but it is not obvious how this knowledge will help with anything.&#8221;",
