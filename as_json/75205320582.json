[&hellip;] More than a dozen articles have already been published and, Knight says, &ldquo;not one scientist has complained about something the kids wanted to fix.&rdquo; That&rsquo;s in spite of some pretty tough criticism. &ldquo;I can see that it shows something about how the brain works,&rdquo; wrote one uncompromising young editor, &ldquo;but it is not obvious how this knowledge will help with anything.&rdquo;",
