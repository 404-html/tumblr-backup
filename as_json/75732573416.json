Theirs is a brief life, full of toil, of work so incessant that in the full flow of summer activity it yields to the pressure of exacting duty; and within a few weeks they drop and die, sacrificed to the demands of destiny, martyrs to the common good. If born in the autumn months they can survive the winter time of rest, and with the opening spring begin the work which unborn generations are to take up and carry to completion.",
