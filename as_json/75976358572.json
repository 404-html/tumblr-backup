I&rsquo;m imagining a policeman going, &ldquo;hmm, this looks like it might be the work of You-K&hellip;&rdquo;, before stopping, aghast, and looking frantically around for ghostly apparitions. &ldquo;Looks like a terrible accident to me. Let&rsquo;s stop for the night and go home&rdquo;, his superior mutters, before finally mumbling, &ldquo;&hellip; and hug our kids before it&rsquo;s too late.&rdquo;</p>",
