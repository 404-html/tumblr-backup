I&#8217;m imagining a policeman going, &#8220;hmm, this looks like it might be the work of You-K&#8230;&#8221;, before stopping, aghast, and looking frantically around for ghostly apparitions. &#8220;Looks like a terrible accident to me. Let&#8217;s stop for the night and go home&#8221;, his superior mutters, before finally mumbling, &#8220;&#8230; and hug our kids before it&#8217;s too late.&#8221;</p>",
