   "quote-text" : "<p>I get âfake geek girlâ BS in job interviews. I have skipped applying for programming jobs because the ads promote the âbro-centric company culture,â where it is common to drink beer and no one complains about your naughty sense of humor. I have applied at companies that wonât interview me for the position that Iâm qualified for because the type of programming that I do is more typical for guys and this other type over here that I donât do is more typical for girls; in order to show how inclusive of women they are, they strongly encourage me to apply for [girl job] despite me being grossly overqualified for [boy job that I canât be interviewed for]. I have gone to interviews where it is made clear to me that Iâm the affirmative action candidate, that they were intrigued by my claim to play video games [which I was tested on], and then had the technical interviewer act astounded because during my whiteboarding exercise, I followed a coding standard that prevents a security breach and no other applicants didâ and then not gotten the job. I have had jobs where my opinion was dismissed by my superiors who were less qualified than me, who repeatedly interrupted me during demos to tell me that Iâm doing the demo wrong on a product that the interrupter has never usedâ and then gotten fired for calmly standing up to him.</p>\n\n<p>So let me tell you why there are so few games with strong female protagonists and so few games with characters that women can identify with as idealized heroes: games are made by men for themselves.</p>",
