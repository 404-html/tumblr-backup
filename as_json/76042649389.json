   "quote-text" : "<p>According to the report, the delisting proposal was based in part on a single October 2012 paper that contends eastern wolves belong to the species <i>Canis lycaon</i>, distinct from gray wolves in the western half of North America belonging to the species <i>Canis lupus</i>. If the eastern part of the wolfâs historic range was occupied by a different species, according to USFWSâ rationale, then <i>Canis lupus</i> now occupies enough of its historic range to be considered recovered. It can thus be removed from ESA protection. </p>\n\n<p>But the 2012 paper, âAn Account of the Taxonomy of North American Wolves From Morphological and Genetic Analysesâ by biologist Steven M. Chambers and three colleagues, is not universally considered valid by wolf biologists. Scientists on the NCEAS panel pointed out that Chambers et alâs conclusions were based on a few genetic differences between wolf populations that were potentially valid, but not conclusive.</p> \n\n<p>Whatâs more, Chambers and his colleagues are all biologists in the employ of USFWS, and their paper was published in the USFWS journal North American Fauna. Thereâs nothing necessarily nefarious about that: North American Fauna publishes some fine work, and many USFWS biologists are among the best in their fields. </p>\n\n<p>The panel did not reject Chambers et alâs conclusions outright. Nonetheless, the panel agreed unanimously that Chambers et al did not represent the âbest available science,â which is the usual legal standard to which USFWS rulemaking is expected to conform. </p>\n\n<p>The upshot: if it isnât yet settled that eastern wolves are a distinct species, then itâs not yet settled whether the species to which western wolves belong has recovered over enough of its range to no longer need protection. And without that settled science, USFWSâ delisting is called into questionâ¦.</p>\n\n<p>As mentioned earlier, public comment on the delisting proposal has now been reopened, the third time the comment period has been so extended on the controversial proposal. Members of the public wishing to comment on the wolf delisting now have until March 27, and more information, as well as an online copy of the NCEAS review of the proposalâs science, can be found on the <a href=\"http://www.fws.gov/home/wolfrecovery/\">USFWSâs gray wolf recovery page</a>.</p>",
