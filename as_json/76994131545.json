Six times a day he gets its location, within a few hundred feet, through a GPS monitoring device attached to its body. One of the last members of its species, this Great Indian Bustard is part of the latest effort to save its kind from joining the ranks of other extinct birds like the dodo and the passenger pigeon.</p>\n<p>On Christmas day last year, a Great Indian Bustard was fitted with a radio tracking device in a small town in the Western plains of India. Habib, a scientific researcher at the Wildlife Institute of India in Dehradun, is heading the project.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;We know a lot about the ecology of this species, that it lives on grasslands and so on,&rdquo; says Habib, who was recently awarded a Young Scientist Award from UNESCO for his work in involving local communities to conserve a Biosphere reserve in Northern India. &ldquo;But, interestingly the bird is seen for only four to six months of the year. Nobody knows where they go for the rest of time.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Locally known as âMaaldhokâ or âYerbhootâ or âGhorad,â the Great Indian Bustard (Ardeotis nigriceps) was a relatively common sight five decades ago in the semi-arid regions and crop fields across parts of Central and Western India. But today less than 200 remain.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;The Bustard is a very difficult species, since like most birds of arid and semi-arid regions, they move around a lot to better pastures, because rainfall is not uniform in all areas,&rdquo; explains Asad Rahmani, director of the 130-year-old Bombay Natural History Society who has been actively campaigning for the conservation of the Great Indian Bustard for over three decades. &ldquo;If they stick to one area, they have an innate tendency to move for newer pastures, more suitable habitats.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>The species has been dwindling in number for a long time, despite having designated sanctuaries across the country, with a few of these sanctuaries being bereft of even a single bustard today.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Sometimes such sanctuaries are not useful for particular species. There is a need to take a drastically different approach, which most people donât understand&rdquo; says Rahmani, who in 2006 had authored a report entitled âNeed to start Project Bustards.â</p>\n<p>One of the challenges in protecting this species has been the fact that it is generally found in grasslands and farmlands, areas that are difficult to designate as protected areas due to their economic importance. Large-scale agriculture and destruction of grasslands by overgrazing along with hunting in certain areas continue to threaten the species, prompting BirdLife International to declare it as Critically Endangered in 2011.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>(via <a href=\"http://news.mongabay.com/2014/0217-vaidya-great-indian-bustard.html\">mongabay.com</a>)</p></blockquote>",
