Students think that everything is done, and wind up with <strong>no</strong> financial aid for the coming school year because they didnât bother to check. This results in a lot of heartbreak and tears when youâre scrambling to get enrolled!</li>\n</ul><p>So please please PLEASE pay attention when youâre applying for aid. Donât get scammed, and donât get screwed out of help, okay?</p>\n<p>And as another quick tip: make sure you have this yearâs tax information handy (and your parents, if youâre a dependent) to make the process easier. <em>Even if you think you or your folks make too much, apply anyway!</em> Sometimes you could qualify for certain grants and scholarships through your school - but they need your FAFSA info!</p>\n<p>This has been a friendly reminder. Good luck!Â <span>( Â´ â½ ` )ï¾</span></p>\n</blockquote>",
