   "quote-text" : "If you are, yourself, depressed right now, send a signal to someone, anyone you trust. Say the words out loud. Words have power. You are not a freak. You are not icky. You are, simply, human and in great pain. You do not âdeserveâ that pain. You are not less than for feeling it, and you DO deserve love and care and relief from that pain.",
