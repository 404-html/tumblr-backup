   "quote-text" : "The poetâs eye, in a fine frenzy rolling,<br/>\nDoth glance from heaven to earth, from earth to heaven;<br/>\nAnd, as imagination bodies forth<br/>\nThe forms of things unknown, the poetâs pen<br/>\nTurns them to shapes, and gives to airy nothing<br/>\nA local habitation and a name.<br/>\nSuch tricks hath strong imagination,<br/>\nThat, if it would but apprehend some joy,<br/>\nIt comprehends some bringer of that joy;<br/>\nOr, in the night, imagining some fear,<br/>\nHow easy is a bush supposâd a bear."
