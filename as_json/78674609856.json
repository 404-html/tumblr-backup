It&#8217;s kind of sad, but it&#8217;s also an incredible opportunity to decorate your home for free with some Frasier-quality ancient antiques. You&#8217;re one archaeological dumpster dive away from an apartment full of straight-up relics. And since it&#8217;s only second-hand grave robbing, you&#8217;ll be one of the last victims to die from any lingering curse. Everything&#8217;s coming up you!\"</p>",
