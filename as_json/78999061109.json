Â He was easily one of the best philosophers ever. Â He made himself the least wealthy person, hence living in a âBarrelâ. Â He also, upon seeing a child drinking from a river with his hands, smashed his only wooden bowl claiming to be âBested by a childâ. Â He did public stunts to make a point towards customs and norms including eating in the marketplace in Athens which was generally not acceptable. Â When Plato described humans as âFeatherless Bipedsâ he plucked a chicken and brought it to him, saying âhereâs your manâ. Â Plato changed that description to âFeatherless bipeds with armsâ. Â <br/><br/>And hereâs where it gets real.<br/><br/>Diogenes the Cynic became well known all over. Â In fact, Alexander the great, the one man who could have anyone killed just because, went out of his way to find him. Â Upon meeting Diogenes, whom was laying on the ground, he said something to the extent of âAh, the great Diogenes! Â Is there anything that I, Alexander the Great, can do you?â. Â Diogenesâ response was a crude âYes, Get out of my sunlight.â<br/><br/>But, however, Alexander came back another time, to find Diogenes sifting through a pile of bones. Â Alex inquired âDiogenes, what are you doing sifting through that pile of bones?â Diogenes the Cynic responded âIâm trying to distinguish between the bones of your father, and that of a slave. Â I cannot tell the difference.â Â An insult that any man would want the other beheaded for indeed. Â But no, not Alexander. Â <br/><br/>Alexander went on to later say that if he were not Alexander the Great, he would wish to be Diogenes.<br/><br/>Dudeâs a motherfuckingbadass.</p>\n</blockquote>",
