HE QUESTIONS KIDS WITH SOCK PUPPETS BECAUSE HE DOESNâT WANT TO SCARE THEM. HE SAVES DEAN AND SAMâS RELATIONSHIP. HE TAKES CARE OF KEVIN. GARTH HAS A SOLUTION FOR EVERYTHING. GARTH TAKES ON ONE OF THE MOST EMOTIONALLY DAMAGING JOBS AND REMAINS HAPPY, UNBROKEN, AND SMILING.</p>\n<p><em>WHY DOESNâT EVERYONE SHOWER GARTH WITH COMPLIMENTS???</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I MEAN. LOOK AT HIM.Â </p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://38.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_mdcoewjaOK1qcrx0b.gif\"/></p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://38.media.tumblr.com/cb86723271fb6332210be29922cf8a5f/tumblr_mkv03ioKr31rxhjc3o1_500.gif\"/></p>\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://33.media.tumblr.com/6139eb16637cf6d9dfc5fe4cf1f7fb8a/tumblr_inline_midskfs2uo1rn9tmy.gif\"/></p>\n<p>I live a Garth Fitzgerald IV appreciation life.Â </p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Also, look at his face. There is no joke there, no exaggeration. This is the nicest thing anyone has ever said to him. That doesnt mean that people have bullied him or that heâs been emotionally abused, although Iâm sure that he was bullied as a child. It just means that no one ever said anything about him, he heard bad things more than good, but still didnt hear much. This may just be me projecting myself onto him, but it seems that he was invisible to a lot of people. He wasnt spoken to. He wasnt given a chance to prove how good he could be.Â </p>\n<p>Look at the way he drinks, one beer and heâs done. He never drank socially. Look at how he works with children, like heâs a child himself. He didnt get to have a childhood when he was a child, so now heâs making up for it. Look at how he touches. itâs rare and jerky, like he doesnt know how to do it, but when he touches, he touches a lot. His hugs come from all of him and they are so needy.</p>\n<p>He is so desperate for approval, so parched for a bit of good attention. Itâs why he went into hunting. He wasnt getting anywhere with dentistry. People dont like dentists. As a hunter he can grow and develop and prove that he is worth nice words and gentle touches.Â </p>\n</blockquote>",
