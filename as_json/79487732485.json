Read on to find out!Â </p>\n<p>Anyway, hereâs my (surprisingly long) two cents on <em>Hannibal</em> as a feminist filmmaking triumph, largely because youâre too fucking scared whilst watching it to notice how many plum roles are going to ladies and people of color, or how many Satan-worshiping rape gangs itâs refusing to include (cough, cough, rhymes with Blue Corrective, cough) so as to make effective horror that doesnât rely on exploiting women.Â </p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>YES.</p>\n</blockquote>"
