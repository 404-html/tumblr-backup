   "quote-text" : "Apple is a bit like the weather: it doesn&rsquo;t work by other peoples&rsquo; timetables. It just does stuff when it&rsquo;s ready. Having written about all three of Apple, Microsoft and Google since the 1990s, I know that each has its own rhythms for releasing stuff. In Google&rsquo;s case, it&rsquo;s pretty much no rhythm; stuff just bursts out when someone hits a button. Microsoft moves in a lockstep. And Apple fiddles with it until it&rsquo;s done.",
