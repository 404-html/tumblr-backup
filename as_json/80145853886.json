   "answer" : "<p>I think the requirement of a âhappy/healthy endpointâ is where this trips. Â I donât think such a thing properly exists in the way you seem to be wanting it to be. Â Television relies on happy endings, but real life is way messier than that. Â Iâve been coming out of my shell for the past seventeen years, nearly half my life, and still I feel tarnished and tainted and in the clutches of the dumb crap I try to leave behind. Â I am not sure it is entirely possible to leave. Â There will never be a 100% break, and I will always find more dumb crap that pulls me back to that old mindset I escaped.</p>\n<p>And so thatâs why âLet It Goâ means a lot to me â not as a âthis is how I wasâ cry but as a âthis is how I continue to beâ cry. Â And I will have to continue singing it probably until the day I die, as an affirmation. Â I am not there yet, and I am not sure I will ever be. Â </p>",

   "question" : "Curious, and wanted to get the expert&#039;s opinion. I was thinking about how people have embraced &quot;Let It Go&quot; as a celebration of liberation/self-acceptance. The song is far from a happy/healthy end-point for Elsa--she still fears her powers around others and is isolationist. Are the ice powers just an imperfect metaphor, or does the song represent and important and joyful but intermediary step in emotional development, or are the emotions of the song a healthy end point for some people, or what?",
