But hey, thereâs a nice explanation of processes like epenthesis and affrication: Â </p>\n<blockquote>\n<div><strong>When sounds intrude</strong>\n<p>Our anatomy can make some changes more likely than others. The simple mechanics of moving from a nasal sound (âmâ or ânâ) to a non-nasal one can make a consonant pop up in-between. Thunder used to be âthunerâ, and empty âemtyâ. You can see the same process happening now with words like hamster, which often gets pronounced with an intruding âpâ. This is a type ofÂ <strong><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epenthesis\">epenthesis</a></strong>.</p>\n<strong><span>Ch-ch-ch-changes</span></strong>\n<p>YourÂ <a href=\"http://www.bl.uk/learning/langlit/sounds/changing-voices/phonological-change/\">grandmother might not like the way you pronounce tune</a>. She might place a delicate âyâ sound before the vowel, sayingÂ <em>tyune</em>Â where you would sayÂ <em>chune</em>. The same goes for other words like tutor or duke. But this process, calledÂ <strong><a href=\"https://notendur.hi.is/peturk/KENNSLA/02/TOP/tjdj.html\">affrication</a></strong>, is happening, like it or not. Within a single generation it has pretty much become standard English.</p>\n</div>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Epenthesis covers other types of insertion as well, such as the schwa in loanwords with difficult consonant clusters for English speakers (try saying Dmitri or Vlad without a tiny schwa) or the <a href=\"http://allthingslinguistic.com/post/60968736608/phonotactics-or-why-spanish-speakers-drink-esprite\">/<span>É/ in Spanish speakersâ pronunciation of âEspriteâ</span></a><span>. And affrication (or palatalization) is also responsible for the pronunciation of all the words ending inÂ </span><em>-tion</em><span>.Â </span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Thatâs interesting about tune.Â  I never knew that some dialects used âchâ there.Â  Is that limited to the UK?Â  The only pronunciations I was aware of, in the US, are /tjun/ and /tun/.Â  Of course, both /tun/ and /tÊun/ are different ways of resolving the same restriction, namely, /j/ being lost after coronal consonant</p></blockquote>",
