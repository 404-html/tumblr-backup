   "quote-text" : "<p>The best we have at the moment is this Slate poll that is entirely inconclusive: around 30 percent each for dohj and dogue (like âvogueâ), plus around 10 percent each for doggie, dog-eh, and dough-geh, and 20 percent for âwow. such confused.â [â¦]</p>\n\n<p>So I canât tell you the ârightâ way to pronounce doge, because we havenât collectively figured that out yet. But I can explain why everyone is confused. [â¦]</p>\n\n<p>What happens if we try to pronounce doge by analogy with existing English words that end in -oge? Iâll give you a moment to think of some.</p>\n\n<p>Are you stumped? Itâs okay, because there arenât many, and thatâs precisely our problem. [â¦]</p>\n\n<p>Weâre left with eight possible words to use as analogies: anagoge, apagoge, epagoge, gamboge, horologe, isagoge, loge, and paragoge. [â¦]</p>\n\n<p>We could go look up these eight uncommon words and how to say them, but thatâs not going to help the average person whoâs trying to figure out the pronunciation of doge by analogy, so letâs see what other words we could reason from instead.</p>\n\n<p>There are two types of words that might be useful here: words ending in -ge, such as camouflage or beverage, and words ending in -o_e, where the blank is some other consonant, such as code or gone. You might notice a problem with these examples: For every possible analogy, there are several different but completely reasonable pronunciations. And matters arenât helped by the multiple pronunciations for words ending in -ogue, such as vogue or catalogue, and -ouge, such as rouge and gouge.</p>\n\n<p>Perhaps in a year or two the dust will have settled and weâll have arrived at some sort of consensus on how to say this tricksy little word. But for the moment, my Official Linguist Pronunciation Advice on the word doge is âYou know that meme? With the shiba inus? Doh-something? Yeah, that one.â</p>",
