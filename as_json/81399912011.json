It is a rare and difficult psychological achievement.</span></li>\n<li><span>A musician must make music, an artist must paint, a poet must write, if he is to be ultimately at peace with himself. What a man can be, he must be.</span></li>\n<li><span>What is necessary to change a person is to change his awareness of himself.</span></li>\n<li><span>Sometimes I think weâre alone in the universe, and sometimes I think weâre not. In either case the idea is quite staggering.</span></li>\n</ol><p><strong>Maslow</strong><span> was an American psychologist who was best known for creating </span><em>Maslowâs hierarchy of needs</em><span>, a theory of psychological health predicated on fulfilling innate human needs in priority, culminating in self-actualisation. His works includeÂ </span><em>Toward a Psychology of Being</em><span> and </span><em>Motivation and Personality</em><span>.</span></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.psy-expert.ru/index/0-23\">Source</a><span> for Image</span><br/><span></span></p>\n<p>by<a href=\"http://writerswrite1.wordpress.com/about-amanda-patterson-founder/\"> Amanda Patterson</a> for <a href=\"http://writerswrite1.wordpress.com/2013/04/01/literary-birthday-1-april-abraham-harold-maslow/\">Writers Write</a></p>\n</blockquote>",
