Scientists used the Hubble mosaic to create a spectacular video of the Monkey Head Nebula to explain the new cosmic views.</small></p>\n  \n  <p><small>&ldquo;Massive, newly formed stars near the center of the nebula (and toward the right in this image) are blasting away at dust within the nebula,&rdquo; Hubble officials wrote in a description of the image, which was captured in February and released on Monday (March 17). <a href=\"http://www.space.com/15235-hubble-space-telescope-latest-photos.html\">You can see more Monkey Head Nebula views here</a>, along with other Hubble Space Telescope images.</small></p>\n  \n  <p><small>&ldquo;Ultraviolet light from these bright stars helps carve the dust into giant pillars. The nebula is mostly composed of hydrogen gas, which becomes ionized by the ultraviolet radiation,&rdquo; they added. &ldquo;As the interstellar dust particles are warmed from the radiation from the stars in the center of the nebula, they heat up and begin to glow at infrared wavelengths.&rdquo;</small></p>\n</blockquote></blockquote>",
