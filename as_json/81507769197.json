   "question" : "Are you still talking about your special snowflake disease, and how you can&#039;t go for a walk because of &quot;muh genetics&quot;? Stop making these sad excuses. You&#039;re a 30 something year old boy living with his parents. Go enter the real world and lose some weight, and stop campaigning for an unrecognized and unreal &quot;illness&quot;.",

   "answer" : "<p>Actually, there is a special snowflake disease. <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myasthenia_gravis\">Myasthenia gravis</a>Â is called âsnowflake diseaseâ because it affects those afflicted so differently.Â </p>\n<p>But I donât have that.Â </p>\n<p>If you are speaking of Chronic Fatigue Syndrome, I will admit there is not a strong diagnostic test that can prove I have it. But, much like gravity, it can be proven to exist through observation.</p>\n<p>You drop a pencil and it falls to the floor.</p>\n<p>Doctors test my blood and find a retrovirus that is very common in people with CFS.</p>\n<p>You go in one of those spinny things at the fair, you stick to the wall.</p>\n<p>Doctors evaluate my symptoms, rule out all other possibilities, and diagnose me.Â </p>\n<p>I am 32.</p>\n<p>I do live with my parents. They are pretty neat.Â </p>\n<p>I went to the real world last night! I even took pictures!</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://31.media.tumblr.com/5a250d89f692ceba91e07b73ac8bf6a1/tumblr_inline_n3e1629bcC1qzs6oc.jpg\"/></p>\n\n<p>I am glad I did that, but right now I feel quite miserable. Itâs very distressing, Iâm in a lot of pain, I cried a bunch because the hangover fatigue was so intense, and I havenât been able to move most of the day. Which is maybe why I donât go to the real world all that often. FUN!</p>\n<p>I lost about 20 pounds, but for some reason I canât seem to lose anymore. My weight is an issue I have tried to address for a very long time. Itâs hard for healthy folks to lose weight. Would logic not dictate it would be a great deal harder for people with debilitating fake illnesses?</p>\n<p>Also, ~50% of my problem is narcolepsy. Which does have a definitive diagnostic test. The treatment is usually stimulants, but in my case the side effects were much worse than the benefits. So even if you think the CFS is a magical concoction of my brainâ¦ I have a whole ânother crappy disease that makes it totally legit for me to make excuses.</p>\n<p>Thoughâ¦ it would be nice if you didnât throw CFS under the bus like that. It affects millions of people and it sucks plenty on its own. Not just fat folks like me. Skinny people. Old people. Young people. It really doesnât care. Yet there are a legion of doubtful blatherskitesÂ like you who seem intent on adding another layer of suck to this already sucky illness.</p>\n<p>Every recognized medical institution says you are wrong.</p>\n<p>But hey, gravity is just a theory, right?</p>",
