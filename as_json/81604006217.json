   "photo-caption" : "<p><a class=\"tumblr_blog\" href=\"http://mapsontheweb.zoom-maps.com/post/81597964099/voronoi-map-of-national-parks-the-usa-divided\">mapsontheweb</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Voronoi Map of National Parks: the USA divided into regions based on which national park is closest</p>\n<p><small>Source: <a href=\"http://www.reddit.com/user/wouj\">wouj (reddit)</a></small></p>\n<p>wouj:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<div class=\"md\">\n<p>I was thinking about the <a href=\"http://i.imgur.com/kgVe9TC.png\">Voronoi diagram of state capitals</a> thatâs been on here before, and it occurred to me that because national parks are often the destination of road trips, they would be a relatively useful subject for a Voronoi map. Hence, this submission!</p>\n<p>One limitation: obviously, national parks are not point locations (there are nine states smaller than Wrangell-St. Elias NPâ¦) For the 59 points on this map, I just used the locations of the national park labels on Google Maps, which are all pretty centrally located. This simplification throws off the âtrueâ boundaries a little.</p>\n<p><strong>Edit:</strong> Many people are commenting about what does and doesnât count as a national park. Here is an excellent, detailed map of the whole U.S. park system: <a href=\"http://www.nps.gov/hfc/carto/PDF/NPSmap2.pdf\">http://www.nps.gov/hfc/carto/PDF/NPSmap2.pdf</a> My map includes the 59 things explicitly designated âNational Parkâ, which on that map includes anything ending in âNPâ or âNP &amp; PRESâ. Yes there are many non-âNational Parkâs that are equally worth visiting, but thatâs a job for another map.</p>\n<p>And as long as Iâm editing this post, three observations that struck me while I was making the map: 1. Itâs kind of ironic that Hot Springs âownsâ the largest âterritoryâ, since itâs the smallest park (and really doesnât fit in with the others in other respects - e.g. itâs located in an urban area). 2. I was genuinely shocked to learn that <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isle_Royale_National_Park\">Isle Royale</a> is the least visited national park in the lower 48, since I grew up in Minnesota where people talked about going there a lot! 3. I enjoy how Dry Tortugas, although itâs in Florida, manages to be the closest national park to <em>nowhere in the continental US</em>.</p>\n</div>\n</blockquote>\n</blockquote>",
