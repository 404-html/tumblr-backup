That&#8217;s new.</p>\n\n<p>EDIT: @dataanxiety, @clueroflooks: thanks for your concern! ^_^ It was nothing dramatic: a skin fissure on my finger opened up without me noticing, and the next thing I knew, there was blood under on my laptop. Some water and elbow grease got it out quickly. No harm done!</p>",
