   "quote-text" : "But this is bigger than one script. I have a long history with Flickr. I served as an advisor to Stewart Butterfield and Caterina Fake when they were working on a game called Game Neverending, and Stewart offered to prioritize GNE&rsquo;s photo-sharing feature to help me court a woman I&rsquo;d started dating overseas. The feature was so successful they folded up GNE and renamed it Flickr, and now I am married to that woman. I owe my marriage to Flickr, and Flickr exists in part because of my marriage.",
