   "quote-text" : "Like most girls, my daughter hears, âThatâs a pretty dress, did you pick it yourself?â or âWhat lovely hair you have,â or âYou have the most amazing eyelashes,â or âI like the bows on your shoes,â or âYou are so cuteâ almost every time somebody engages in conversation with her. \n<br/><br/>If family, friends, shop assistants, complete strangers, and even Santa only remark on how girls look, rather than what they think and do, how can we expect girls to believe that they have anything more to offer the world than their beauty?",
