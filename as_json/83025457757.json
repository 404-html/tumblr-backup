   "quote-text" : "People donât like her because itâs the making of her, right now. When she, sometime soon in the future, becomes this person that sheâs been kind of building up to, for the past three seasons, now four, then people will really begin to root for her. I think even the audience doesnât realize sheâs such a dark horse. If she acted badass and tried to kill everyone there, she would be dead by now! Sheâs so intelligent, and I canât stress that enough. Courtesy is a ladyâs armor. Sheâs using her courtesy to deceive people, and sheâs using her former self as a facade, and it works so much to her advantage, because people still think sheâs this naive, vulnerable, little girl, and sheâs really not. She knows exactly what sheâs doing. She knows what game sheâs playing! And no one else does. And sheâs learned from the best â Cersei, Margaery, Tyrion, Littlefinger, even Joffrey. Sheâs learned so much from these people, and they donât even realize it. Theyâre unwittingly feeding her to become this great kind of manipulator. Kingâs Landing can either make or break a person, and in Sansaâs case, itâs making her.",
