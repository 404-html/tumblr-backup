Looking to get out of the academy altogether? Already made an interesting career move that worked out? Talk about it here on our newÂ <span>Flexible Academics</span>Â support group</strong></em></a></p>\n<ul><li><span>by Dr. Elizabeth Keenan (Fordham University)</span></li>\n</ul><p>&ldquo;These days, everyone knows academia is aÂ <a href=\"http://thesiswhisperer.com/2011/08/09/is-the-university-a-bad-boyfriend/\">bad</a>Â <a href=\"http://chronicle.com/article/We-Are-Never-Ever-Getting-Back/143989/\">boyfriend</a>Â (or girlfriend, depending on your sexual preference). Everyone has their own tale about how it keeps pulling them back in, with tantalizing offers of interviews and seductive whispers of funding, and then crushing their hopes into the tiny shards of a broken career.</p>\n<p>This isnât one of those columns. No, this is a column about having âThe Talk.â Not the imaginary one you have with the academy itselfâthe one in which you finally kick it to the curb. I mean the one youâll have repeatedly with everyone youâve known professionally in the past decade of your life.</p>\n<p>See, thereâs a difference between bad relationships and academia. When you finally escape a bad relationship, most of your friends will suddenly confess, âI never liked him/her anyway!â Or theyâll join you in a round (or six) while you cry in your beer.Â They wonât tell you, âWell, why donât you just give it another year? Heâs a really nice guy when he isnât ignoring you!â Or: âSurely if you just tried to make it work, she would stop cheating.â</p>\n<p>And yet, in academia, you hear those thingsÂ <em>all the time.</em>Â As soon as you tell someone, âIâm thinking of leaving,â theyâll come back at you with a list of reasons you should stay, give it another year, try harder, and maybe a job will open up. People who try to keep you in academia mean well: Either they have succeeded and donât understand why you havenât, or theyâre in the same position as you and theyâre terrified of leaving. But that doesnât make talking to them any easier.</p>\n<p>This can make the transition out of academia cripplingly lonely, especially if a lot of your friends and mentors are still on the inside. (And then thereâs the problem that your friends outside academia wonât be able to relate, though they will try. At least some of them will buy you drinks.)â (<a href=\"https://chroniclevitae.com/news/434-leaving-academia-it-s-time-to-have-the-talk#sthash.3lMD1QXH.uxfs\">read more</a>).</p>\n<p><strong>***The problem is, whenever I think Iâll stay out for good, I realise that finding a non-academic job thatâs an actual career job, not just a pay the rent and hope for the best job, is no easier to find than an academic job.Â </strong></p>\n<p>(Source: <a href=\"https://chroniclevitae.com/news/434-leaving-academia-it-s-time-to-have-the-talk#sthash.3lMD1QXH.uxfs\">Vitae</a>)</p></blockquote>",
