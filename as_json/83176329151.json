   "quote-text" : "<p>A police officer from West Hartford had pulled up across the street, exited his vehicle, and begun walking in my direction. I noted the strangeness of his being in Hartfordâan entirely separate town with its own police forceâso I thought he needed help. He approached me with purpose, and then, without any introduction or explanation he asked, âSo, you trying to make a few extra bucks, shoveling peopleâs driveways around here?â</p>\n\n<p>All of my homeowner confidence suddenly seemed like an illusion.</p>\n\n<p>It would have been all too easy to play the âDo you know who I am?â game. My late father was an immigrant from Trinidad who enrolled at Howard University at age 31 and went on to become a psychiatrist. My mother was an important education reformer from the South. I graduated from an Ivy League school with an engineering degree, only to get selected in the first round of the Major League Baseball draft. I went on to play professionally for nearly 15 years, retiring into business then going on to write a book and a column for The New York Times. Today, I work at ESPN in another American dream job that lets me file my taxes under the description âbaseball analyst.â</p>\n\n<p>But I didnât mention any of this to the officer. I tried to take his question at face value, explaining that the Old Tudor house behind me was my own. The more I talked, the more senseless it seemed that I was even answering the question. But I knew I wouldnât be smiling anymore that day.</p>",
