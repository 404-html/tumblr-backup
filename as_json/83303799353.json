Imagine what happens when you ask them to define âsandwich.â As usual, the tweets are only slightly reordered to maintain some semblance of narrative.</div>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Is a taco a sandwich?</p>\n<p>What about a quesadilla, a panini, an ice cream sandwich, a wrap, a burrito, a calzone, a burger, a hot dog, a sâmore, a folded pizza, or a twinkie?Â </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://storify.com/jgold85/what-is-a-sandwich\">This twitter discussion</a>, although entertaining,Â would probably have benefited from an approach using <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prototype_theory\">prototype theory</a> instead of a definition-based model.</p>\n<p>For example, instead of trying to decide whether two slices of leavened bread is necessary for a sandwich (what about open-faced or pita sandwiches?), we can agree that ham-and-swiss is a very prototypical sandwich, paninis and wraps slightly less so, and a sâmore or folded pizza are very un-prototypical but could possibly be considered edge-case sandwiches.</p>\n</blockquote>",
