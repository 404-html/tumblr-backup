He positioned himself so that he could see his own body using a mirror when doing the surgery - he made a 12Â cm cut through which he found the appendix. After 5 days the doctor felt good, and after 7 days he removed the wires which had been used to sew up the body.</span><br/><br/><span>Source:Â </span><a href=\"http://bit.ly/1hVZwQN\" rel=\"nofollow nofollow\">http://bit.ly/1hVZwQN</a></p>\n<p>through<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=260129477491772&amp;set=pb.165478916956829.-2207520000.1398014804.&amp;type=3&amp;theater\"> DA</a></p>\n</blockquote>",
