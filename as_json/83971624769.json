   "quote-text" : "In general, people are not drawn to perfection in others. People are drawn to shared interests, shared problems, and an individualâs life energy. Humans connect with humans. Hiding oneâs humanity and trying to project an image of perfection makes a person vague, slippery, lifeless, and uninteresting."
