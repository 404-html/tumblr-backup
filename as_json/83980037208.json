You went to college!â</p>\n<p>and Horatio is like âYeah! IÂ <em>did</em> go to college! I will go talk to the ghost!â</p>\n<p>like. where did horatio go to college. did he go to <em>ghost college</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Back then, though, college was something that not many people went to.Â  It was like, if you went to college, you were seen by the general public as a ~ genius scholar ~.Â  So, of course Horatio would know what to say, heâs a scholar!Â  He knows everything there is to know!</p>\n<p>As an example of how widespread that view was, the word âglamourâ comes from Scots âglamerâ, derived from âgramaryeâ meaning âmagic, enchantment, spellâ, which is most likely from âgrammarâ in the older sense of âlearning, scholarshipâ.</p></blockquote>",
