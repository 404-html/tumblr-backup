In business speak we were âacquired,â but that sounds so one-sided. Weâve been working with our friends at the Academy on various projects for over a year now, and weâve talked about joining the fold for just as long, so thereâs nothing one-sided about it. Scottâs a native Californian and Ken-ichiâs basically a naturalized Californian at this point in his Golden State tenure, so weâve both looked up to the Academy for a long time, and we know theyâre just as passionate about connecting people to nature as we are.</p>\n\n<h3>Why are you doing this?</h3>\n<p>We need the money! Seriously. To date weâve sustained ourselves predominantly through project-specific contracts and grants, which has been great, but since they limit the kinds of work we can do to projects other people are willing to fund, there are a number of things weâve been unable to tackle. The Academy can offer us the stability we need to address important but unsexy issues like performance and usability.</p>\n\n<p>To be honest, neither of us got into this to run a business. Scottâs a biologist, Ken-ichiâs a web dork, and weâre both naturalists, so weâd much rather spend time doing these things and improving our products than, say, doing our company taxes. Joining the Academy gives us a way to achieve that focus.</p>\n\n<p>And, as you probably know, the Academy is awesome, and staffed by awesome people. Itâs hard to think of a better community of professionals dedicated to communicating the value of the natural world to humanity. Working alongside the kind of energy and creativity the Academy provides can only benefit us.</p>\n\n<h3>Whatâs going to change?</h3>\n<p>Right now, not much! Our brand wonât change, and neither will the core mission and experience of the site and our apps, but in the future weâre hoping to hire some new staff, work on ways to make the site faster, and improve our mobile apps. Weâre not sure about Terms of Service and our privacy policy yet, but no doubt weâll be having that conversation soon and will keep everyone posted.</p>\n\n<p>Scott &amp; Ken-ichi (aka loarie &amp; kueda)</p>\n\n<p>P.S. Hereâs the <a href=\"http://www.calacademy.org/newsroom/releases/2014/inaturalist.php\">press release from the Academy</a>.</p></blockquote>",
