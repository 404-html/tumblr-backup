I care. Iâm pretty sure a lot of people care. I want to hear that the people I care about are having delicious breakfasts or saw something odd at work or flirted with a cute barista. Or just any little thoughts they have that they feel are worth sharing.</p>\n<p>Iâve always kind of assumed thatâs how youâre supposed to feel about your friends.</p>\n</blockquote>",
