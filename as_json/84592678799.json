And just let me tell you, thereâs something incredibly calming and reassuring about looking next to you while youâre on the toilet and seeing 30 rolls of toilet paper sitting there. You get a feeling like, no matter how bad shit gets in there, youâre always going to make it out okay in the end.</p>\n</blockquote>",
