   "answer" : "<p>I think that the thing about all relationships is that not all desires will mesh perfectly anyhow. Um, and this is actually a very interesting question considering the history between me and my gf. (Note that I call her my gf but she is bigender without a major pronoun preference.)</p>\n<p>We met in college and initially when I found out she was ace I too said it couldnât work, I need sex, etc etc. (This after she had expressed romantic interest in me.) And at that point I also had a very simple understanding of the word âasexualâ- I thought it meant NO SEX AT ALL EVER. Granted, at this point, even if my gf said NO SEX AT ALL EVER Iâd probably be ok with it.</p>\n<p>The other interesting thing is that I myself was struggling with my own sexual identity at the timeâ¦ I knew that I was bisexual (with the correct definition being liking same and different genders, mind you) but I was beginning to wonder if I was aromantic because I had never felt anything more than a shallow crush on someone.</p>\n<p>So here we had my asexual, fairly romantic then-roommate and me, the possibly-aromantic allsexual schlub.</p>\n<p>Probably what really led to our successful (nearly a year now!) relationship was the fact that we were roommates for a year before that and we got pretty close and really comfortable with another just as friends. It was right after we graduated that we finally started dating (with our mutual friend yelling at us as we made out on the couch, âSERIOUSLY! START DATING!â)</p>\n<p>Because in the end spending that time with her made me realize I was actually really attracted to her and that she was a person I felt incredibly comfortable with. And sex mattered a hell of a lot less to me than that.</p>\n<p>I canât speak for all ace people (and I will ask the gf to weigh in on this I think) but I believe in her case, the fact that she is also very comfortable with me, makes it a lot easier to do sexual things. And we really donât do them often or NEED to do them often, and Iâm always doing my best to respect her boundaries and sheâs really good about telling me when sheâs ready to stop.</p>\n<p>I think for a lot of allosexual people, we get it ingrained in us that sex is SUCH a necessity for romantic relationships when it really isnât. And not to say that sex isnât a much more important aspect for other allosexual people that arenât me- I know it is! But I think thereâs inherent pressure at least in the society I live in that sexual consummation has to happen for a relationship to be real. And thatâs just silly. (What about romantic relationships involving people who physically canât have sex?)</p>\n<p>I think essentially what makes our relationship work is that, to quote you above, neither of us are âsacrificing our comfort.â Rather, we spend most of our time communicating to each other what we are and arenât comfortable with, which makes things like boundaries SO much easier to define.</p>\n<p>I dunno. It just works out! For all my anxieties at the beginning, every time Iâm with her makes me want to be with her even more.</p>\n<p>Er, sorry this response got so long.</p>",
   "question" : "So yesterday you posted about your gf being ace and you not, and I was wondering...how does that work? I&#039;m ace, but I&#039;ve never been in a relationship, and one of the big reasons is that I&#039;ve never been attracted to another ace person and a relationship between ace and non-ace seems almost incompatible. Someone has to sacrifice a huge bit of their comfort to make that relationship work, it seems like. (Feel free not to answer this kind of invasive personal question, but I&#039;d love to know.)",
