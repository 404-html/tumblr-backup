Â Itâs a page from the 1901 edition of <em>Grayâs Anatomy</em>. It shows the movement of chromosomes during cell division. Â The reason this blows my mind is that DNA was identified as the molecule of genetic transmission in 1928, and its structure was described in 1953.</p>\n<p>So in 1901, these people were making lovingly detailed drawings of chromosomesÂ <em>even though they had no idea what they were</em>.</p></blockquote>",
