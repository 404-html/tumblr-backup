There is then a zoom in on the enzymatic process doing the work of transcription on the molecular level, showing an RNA polymerase processing up the DNA double helix, and the newly transcribed RNA that is winding out of the complex. It is inspired by the old Transmission Electron Micrographs of transcribing rRNA genes, as bacteriophage viral genes are at least as strongly transcribed in early infection, and David Goodsellâs classic drawing of an RNA polymerase in his magnificent book, The Machinery of Life.</div>\n<div><br/>The arrows around the magnifying glass represent an operon level transcription map of a phage that I made with single nucleotide resolution as part of my doctoral work. (with the frame slightly obscured because the data is, at least previously, unpublished)</div>\n</blockquote>",
