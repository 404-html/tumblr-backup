Konrath (via <a class=\"tumblr_blog\" href=\"http://tsukishiro.co.vu/\">lonachu</a>)</p>\n\n<p>Weirdly enough, I think I&rsquo;m going/need to go in the opposite direction : I&rsquo;ve always been very unconcerned by what people think of me, but maybe that leads to a life that&rsquo;s peaceful, serene, boring and lonely. There is a reason that my favourite novel is <em>The Year of the Death of Ricardo Reis</em>.</p>"
