   "quote-text" : "The Greeks understood the mysterious power of the hidden side of things. They bequeathed to us one of the most beautiful words in our languageâthe word âenthusiasmââen theosâa god within. The grandeur of human actions is measured by the inspiration from which they spring. Happy is he who bears a god within, and who obeys it.",
