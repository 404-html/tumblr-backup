   "quote-text" : "<p>Most of the characters in my fantasy and far-future science fiction books are not white. Theyâre mixed; theyâre rainbow. In my first big science fiction novel, The Left Hand of Darkness, the only person from Earth is a black man, and everybody else in the book is Inuit (or Tibetan) brown. In the two fantasy novels the miniseries is âbased on,â everybody is brown or copper-red or black, except the Kargish people in the East and their descendants in the Archipelago, who are white, with fair or dark hair. The central character Tenar, a Karg, is a white brunette. Ged, an Archipelagan, is red-brown. His friend, Vetch, is black. In the [Sci Fi Channel] miniseries, Tenar is played by Smallvilleâs Kristin Kreuk, the only person in the miniseries who looks at all Asian. Ged and Vetch are white.</p>\n\n<p>My color scheme was conscious and deliberate from the start. I didnât see why everybody in science fiction had to be a honky named Bob or Joe or Bill. I didnât see why everybody in heroic fantasy had to be white (and why all the leading women had âviolet eyesâ). It didnât even make sense. Whites are a minority on Earth nowâwhy wouldnât they still be either a minority, or just swallowed up in the larger colored gene pool, in the future? [â¦]</p>\n\n<p>I think it is possible that some readers never even notice what color the people in the story are. Donât notice, donât care. Whites of course have the privilege of not caring, of being âcolorblind.â Nobody else does.</p>\n\n<p>I have heard, not often, but very memorably, from readers of color who told me that the Earthsea books were the only books in the genre that they felt included inâand how much this meant to them, particularly as adolescents, when theyâd found nothing to read in fantasy and science fiction except the adventures of white people in white worlds. Those letters have been a tremendous reward and true joy to me. </p>\n\n<p>So far no reader of color has told me I ought to butt out, or that I got the ethnicity wrong. When they do, Iâll listen. As an anthropologistâs daughter, I am intensely conscious of the risk of cultural or ethnic imperialismâa white writer speaking for nonwhite people, co-opting their voice, an act of extreme arrogance. In a totally invented fantasy world, or in a far-future science fiction setting, in the rainbow world we can imagine, this risk is mitigated. Thatâs the beauty of science fiction and fantasyâfreedom of invention.</p>\n\n<p>But with all freedom comes responsibility. Which is something these filmmakers seem not to understand.</p>",
