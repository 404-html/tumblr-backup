Itâs a cartoon manatee, quite adorable-looking (if I do say so myself :p) with âxox manateeâ written beneath it. While Iâm trying to sleep tonight, Iâll look at it and remember that someone out there has done a lot to help people. While I try to get myself to school, knowing that people could try to hurt me and that Iâm not doing as well as I want, someone knows I donât have to internalize it and that I look great today. (1)</em><br/><em>While Iâm alone, struggling to practice self-care and reach my potential, Iâll look at that cute freaking manatee on my skin and know someone out there believes in me, even if sometimes I donât believe in myself. :) I hope you follow your own advice, âcause someone who helps people like you do deserves ten times more! Iâm a better human now, and I will always love manatees like you. Thank you, thank you, thank you. Also, you look nice today, too. You always do. (2)</em><br/><br/>Iâm not crying, youâre crying.</p></blockquote>",
