Maybe your way of taking care of yourself is taking a trip to visit a friend, asking for help around the lab, creating new ways to do things,  saying no, planning your meals ahead of time so that you can eat well, forming a writing group, taking a shower, telling your family that you arenât doing well, or quitting your degree.",
