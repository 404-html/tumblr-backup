   "quote-text" : "To define Hindutva, or &ldquo;Hinduness&rdquo; as the suitable basis for nationalism, the first step was to redefine what counts as a religion. In a pre-election interview Mr Modi took the RSS line: that &ldquo;Hinduism [is] not a religion, but a way of life&rdquo;. This might come as a surprise to many of Indiaâs religious minorities &ndash; Muslims, Sikhs, Christians and many others. In the modern, economic-policy-oriented BJP, the equation of Hindus to Indians is supposed to sound welcoming. But there is a contradiction here, and Muslims feel it most sharply. If your fatherland is India but your holy land is Mecca, then you are something less than wholly Hindu, and less than wholly Indian. The persistent shame of Hindu nationalism has been its ambition to define Indianness in contradistinction to being a Muslim.",
