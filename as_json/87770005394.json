Think of what the real day-to-day of life is taken up by. Life is birthday parties at terrible pubs. Life is losing your credit card and the annual Melbourne Cup sweepstake in the office. Life is henâs nights, bucksâ nights, sitting on the phone for three hours to get U2 tickets and not getting them, the apartment upstairs flooding your house, interval training, calorie counting, cancer scares, illegal mini cabs, Secret Santa, rail replacement buses and Dido albums. Dogs die, cars crash, bin liners break, contracts end, curtain rails collapse, trains get delayed, football teams lose. Divorce happens and so do earthquakes and so does An Audience With Michael BublÃ©. Landlords put rent up, phones get stolen and the supermarket often completely runs out of hummus.</p>\n\n<p>Now, taking all of the above into account â you look me dead in the eye and tell me the truth. Do you really have enough spare energy to pursue someone who isnât interested in you? Do you really want to waste any more time on top of all of that? No. Me neither. So give it up, my friend. Itâs a loserâs game. Delete their number. Donât go on any more dates with them. Stop lurking their Facebook page. Feels good, doesnât it?</p>",
