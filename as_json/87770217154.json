YOU/WE BUT MOSTLY YOU JUST THEORIZED MAGICAL POST-COLONIAL THEORY LIKE HOLY SHIT I AM GOING TO PLOTZ PLEASE MARRY ME.</p>\n<p>And omg I just realized but if you look at Elphias Dogeâs obituary of Dumbledore, he does take an extremely Orientalist tone we he discusses the magical practices of non-Western European magical communities.</p>\n<p>I havenât been excited like this since I realized that goblin views of production, ownership, and purchasing are hella Marxist.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>TBH probably my favorite thing about the fic Dumbledoreâs Army and the Year of Darkness is the inclusion of nonstandard and indigenous magical practices</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>It took a few paragraphs to realize we were talking about Harry Potter. I was about to pull out my admittedly limited knowledge of occult history. :)</p>\n</blockquote>",
