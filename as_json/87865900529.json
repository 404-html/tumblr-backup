On may 3, one of them captured an image of a black wolf. It was in the area where theyâve been tracking OR-7 with a GPS collar. A photo of the wolf squatting to urinate helped them determine it was female.</p>\n<p>At the time, biologists said they didnât know for sure that OR-7 was breeding with the female. But the newest photos of wolf pups released by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife have confirmed that theory.</p>\n<p>The pups mark the first known wolf reproduction in the Oregon Cascades since the mid-1940s.</p>\n<p>âThis is very exciting news,â said Paul Henson, State Supervisor of the Oregon Fish and Wildlife Office. âIt continues to illustrate that gray wolves are being recovered.â</p>\n<p>State and federal agencies donât disclose the exact locations of wolves, though theyâve said OR-7, his mate and pups are in eastern Jackson County in the Rogue-Siskiyou National Forest.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>(via <a href=\"http://earthfix.opb.org/flora-and-fauna/article/wolf-or-7-is-a-new-dad/\">EarthFix Â· Oregon Public Broadcasting</a>)</p>\n<p>Photo: <em>Two of wolf OR7âs pups peek out from a log on the Rogue River-Siskiyou National Forest, June 2, 2014.
