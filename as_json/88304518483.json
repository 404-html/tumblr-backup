   "quote-source" : "Andrew Johnson, totally dissing Ulysses S. Grant in an interview with the New York Herald shortly after Grant succeeded him as President, June 27, 1869 (via <a class=\"tumblr_blog\" href=\"http://deadpresidents.tumblr.com/\">deadpresidents</a>)",
   "quote-text" : "<p>I know Grant thoroughly. I had ample opportunity to study him when I was President, and I am convinced he is the greatest farce that was ever thrust upon a people. Why, the little fellow â excuse me for using that expression, but I canât help pitying him â the little fellow has nothing in him. He hasnât a single idea. He had no policy, no conception of what the country requires. He donât understand the philosophy of a single great question, and is completely lost in trying to understand his situation. He is mendacious, cunning, and treacherousâ¦</p>\n\n<p>I tell you, sir, Grant is nothing more than a bundle of petty spites, jealousies, and resentments. And yet they say Grant is a second Washington. Only think of it, when you compare him with Washington or Jefferson, where is he? Why he is so small you must put your finger on him. He, a little upstart, a coward, physically and intellectually, to be compared to George Washington! Why, it makes me laughâ¦</p>\n\n<p>Grant has nothing. Physically and mentally and morally he is a nonentity. Why, sir, his soul is so small that you could put it within the periphery of a hazel nutshell and it might float about for a thousand years without knocking against the walls of the shell. Thatâs the size of his soulâ¦</p>\n\n<p>He has no idea, no policy, no standard, no creed, no faith. How can he guide the people? How can he impress any great improvements or moral ideas upon the nation?â¦The little fellow has come to think he is somebody really. I canât help pitying him when I think how well I know him and what an infinitessimal creature he really isâ¦</p>",
