   "quote-text" : "Batman shoots some cables from the Batpod that down the Joker&#8217;s truck. Joker gets out and then attempts to play chicken with him, standing in the middle of the road screaming &#8220;HIT ME! HIT ME!&#8221; as Batman just rushes headlong towards him. You can tell Batman&#8217;s actually considering it, too, because when he swerves at the last minute it&#8217;s not very graceful and he ends up crashing the Batpod and apparently passing out in the middle of the street. It&#8217;s a great scene, since the Joker knows that if Batman kills him, he wins. He&#8217;s corrupted him forever and proved his point. If Batman doesn&#8217;t kill him, well, he&#8217;s got a plan for that too.",
