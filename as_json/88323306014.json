   "quote-text" : "Batman shoots some cables from the Batpod that down the Joker&rsquo;s truck. Joker gets out and then attempts to play chicken with him, standing in the middle of the road screaming &ldquo;HIT ME! HIT ME!&rdquo; as Batman just rushes headlong towards him. You can tell Batman&rsquo;s actually considering it, too, because when he swerves at the last minute it&rsquo;s not very graceful and he ends up crashing the Batpod and apparently passing out in the middle of the street. It&rsquo;s a great scene, since the Joker knows that if Batman kills him, he wins. He&rsquo;s corrupted him forever and proved his point. If Batman doesn&rsquo;t kill him, well, he&rsquo;s got a plan for that too.",
