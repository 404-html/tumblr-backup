Weâre given such limited amount of information about the guy that sells Jack the beans. essentially:</p>\n<ul><li>This guy has access to MAGIC BEANS</li>\n<li>He either has NO USE for MAGIC BEANS or so many of them that he can just dispose of them</li>\n<li>He really badly wants a cow</li>\n</ul><p>Why is the whole story not about this guy</p>\n</blockquote>",
