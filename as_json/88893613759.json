   "quote-text" : "<p>But there was hope, then. We were not alone and we had our bows and we fought, and we fought and the skies changed. Dream to drear to wish to hope to light. To life. And still we fought, and we fled and they came but we dwindled as the snows melted. So few of us, so few, so few and the gleaming of the dead world in the dawn before the spring shined maddeningly through our minds, so futile, so strange, so injust&hellip; so&hellip; crazy.</p>\n\n<p>And then I was alone.</p>\n\n<p>Alone with the manholes. Alone with the death and the dusk and the soft spring sounds as the birds fluttered lazily overhead, the flowers bloomed mockingly underfoot and the rubble gleaming from the ashes of another ruined civilisation&hellip;</p>",
