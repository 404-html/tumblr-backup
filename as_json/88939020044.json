   "quote-text" : "<p>Unlike Godzilla, Pacific Rim doesnât try to be serious even when itâs being serious. Characters have names like Stacker Pentecost and Hercules Hansen. The film requires you to believe that the best way to battle a giant monster is to build an even larger robot to fight that monster.</p>\n\n<p>Much of the Act 2 drama derives from inter-pilot tension airlifted from the Val Kilmer scenes in Top Gun. Itâs the polar opposite of the Godzilla school of drama, where everyone is a total professional who has absolutely no personal goal besides Saving The World. In Pacific Rim, Idris Elba is Rinko Kikuchiâs Obi-Wan Kenobi, and two of the last Giant Robot-pilots in the world frequently get into sneering fights over whoâs the bigger badass, and Charlie Day is a scientist.</p>\n\n<p>So, for all these reasons, Pacific Rim is a movie that Iâve heard perfectly smart people describe as âstupidâ or âsilly.â The problem with this line of thinking is that, really, that every blockbuster is pretty âsilly,â in the context of Things Adults Should Care About. Godzilla is not less stupid than Pacific Rim just because people frown more. [â¦]</p>\n\n<p>The difference, I think, is that Pacific Rim glories in its own silliness. Thereâs a flashback scene where Idris Elba rescues a little girl, and when he emerges from his giant robot, the sun shines upon him like heâs the catharsis in a biblical epic. Thereâs a moment when one giant robot swings an oil tanker like a sword. Then it grows a sword out of its wrist. Then it falls from space to earth.</p>\n\n<p>There are real complaints to make about Pacific Rim, I guess, all of them fair and most of them pedantic. I know a lot of people who have issues with the story. (âWhy didnât they use the wrist-sword earlier?â is a popular one.) Conversely, I donât really know anyone who minds the story in Godzilla, possibly because everything stupid that happens is prefaced by Frowning Watanabe saying âThis is why the stupid thing thatâs about to happen makes sense.â Godzilla wants so badly to make sense. Pacific Rim wants so badly for Ron Perlman to wear golden shoes.</p>",
