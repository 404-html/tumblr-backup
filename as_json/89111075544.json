There can be no justifying such an intervention on the grounds that it would lead to a sustainable, autonomous, democratic Iraq. The United States lacks the capacity to build such an Iraqi state, or to resolve Sunni-Shiite sectarian warfare. This was decisively proven in a large-scale longitudinal experiment, funded by the Defence Department, that began in 2003, ran for eight years and cost over a trillion dollars.",
