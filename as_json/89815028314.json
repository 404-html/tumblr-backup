The verb reden means at once âto engage in reading a book,â âto perceiveâ or âto interpret,â and even âto tell a storyâ and âto counsel/advise.â* A good reder, then, must do a great deal more than just correctly deduce the contents of a text. </p>\n\n<p>*from âReden,â Middle English Dictionary, 2001, University of Michiganâ¦ The full range of meanings also includes âto teach/instructâ and âto guideâ (to a place of state).</p>",
