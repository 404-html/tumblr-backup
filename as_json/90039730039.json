First, Helm&#8217;s Deep, which is fantastic and perfect and filled with (what looks to me at least) to be very sensible warfare. This is intercut by the very annoying bit where Meriadoc Brandybuck, a young hobbit from the Shire, tricks (!) and angers (!!) the long-lived, unrushed wise old guardian of one of the most ancient forests in Middle Earth. But that leads into the invasion of Isengard, which is brilliantly brilliant again, intercut with the conquest of Osgiliath and the first appearance of the Nazgul at war. Why that horrible Merry bit is in the middle of so much unadulterated brilliance I&#8217;ll never understand.</p>\n\n<p>BRB Samwise Gamgee&#8217;s making shivers go up and down my spine.</p>",
