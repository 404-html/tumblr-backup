Whatâs another 24-hour mandatory abortion waiting period? To a woman who lives 25 miles from the nearest provider, itâs everything. Whatâs one more tweak to a law about the width of clinic doors? To a clinic that canât afford to remodel, itâs everything. Whatâs a minor policy change that means you have to pay full price for that IUD? To a woman who makes $14 an hour, itâs everything.",
