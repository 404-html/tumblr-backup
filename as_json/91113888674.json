   "quote-text" : "I find many adults are put off when young children pose scientific questions. Why is the Moon round? the children ask. Why is grass green? What is a dream? How deep can you dig a hole? When is the worldâs birthday? Why do we have toes? Too many teachers and parents answer with irritation or ridicule, or quickly move on to something else: âWhat did you expect the Moon to be, square?â Children soon recognize that somehow this kind of question annoys the grown-ups. A few more experiences like it, and another child has been lost to science. Why adults should pretend to omniscience before 6-year-olds, I canât for the life of me understand. Whatâs wrong with admitting that we donât know something? Is our self-esteem so fragile?",
