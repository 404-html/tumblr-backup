each other, but heâs moving. we cant hang out cause he has to pack and everything so thats not an option. also later today he said that we need to find other people, if we really do like each other, he wouldnât of said that.. right? so i brought up long distance and he declined it in a heartbeat. he didnât even want to try, i thought he really did like me. please help, i donât know what to do with my life, im a guy</div>\n</blockquote>\n<div class=\"post_body\"></div>\n<div class=\"post_body\">Hello sweetheart. You look very handsome today.<br/><br/>I am going to tell you something, and it is going to sound harsh and for that I am sorry.</div>\n<div class=\"post_body\"></div>\n<div class=\"post_body\">Here is the thing, if someone wants to be with you, they will be with you. Thatâs it. No ifs, no buts, no âif they werenât moving,â or âif things werenât so hard,â no âcircumstances keep us apart,â nothing. If someone really wants to be with you, they will be with you.</div>\n<div class=\"post_body\"></div>\n<div class=\"post_body\">It is harsh, I know, but it is a good thing to know. You are a wonderful person, and you deserve to be with someone who <em>wants</em> to be with you. Iâm sure this man is a great person who cares for you, but he has declined you multiple times. He has looked at everything wonderful that is you, and gone âNo, thank you.â And you deserve better than that. You deserve someone who wants you, who would pack with you, who wouldnât want other people (unless you are in that kind of relationship and are both okay with that), who would want to do long distance if that was the only option.<br/><br/>I know it hurts - liking someone who doesnât feel the same way is one of the worst things in the world. Let yourself be sad. Let yourself mourn for someone who is going away, for hurt feelings, for what could have been. And that is absolutely fine. Give yourself three days to just be absolutely bone-crushingly sad. Then pick yourself up, dust yourself off, and go on with things. Donât feel bad if you are still sad, but try not to let it be a focus on your life. Focus on you - get some exercise, eat nice things, sleep a lot, read things, write lists about how great you are. Focus on you.</div>\n<div class=\"post_body\"></div>\n<div class=\"post_body\">Please know there will be other people for you, people who like you and want you in the way you deserve. You will love and be loved, because you are an incredible person capable of great love. You deserve the best, sweetheart. You deserve to be loved.<br/><br/></div>\n<div class=\"post_body\"></div>\n<div class=\"post_body\">Take care,</div>\n<div class=\"post_body\"></div>\n<div class=\"post_body\">xox Manatee</div>\n<div class=\"post_body\"></div>\n</div>\n</div></blockquote>",
