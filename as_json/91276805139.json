It was hatred, implacable hatred. It was cold, not like iceÂ </span><span>is cold, but like a wall is cold. It was impersonal, not as a randomly flungÂ </span><span>fist in a crowd is impersonal, but like a computer-issued parking summons isÂ </span><span>impersonal. And it was deadly - again, not like a bullet or a knife is deadly,Â </span><span>but like a brick wall across a motorway is deadly.â</span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>And, of course: <br/><br/>&quot;The ships hung in the sky in much the same way that bricks donât.&rdquo;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>the one that will always stay with me is âArthur Dent was grappling with his consciousness the way one grapples with a lost bar of soap in the bath,â i feel like that was the first time i really understood <em>what you could do with words</em>.</p>\n</blockquote>",
