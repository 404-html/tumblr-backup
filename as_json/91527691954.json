I used to sell teddy bears too. But one day last year, three undercover policeman showed up and took me to jail. It was just like a TV showâ one was dressed like a rapper, the other like a hooker, and the other like a tourist. They said you need a permit to sell manufactured goods. Youâre allowed to sell art, just not manufactured goods. I tried to tell them that my teddy bears were art because I dressed them and customized them. But all they said was: âYouâre going to jail.â I had to spend 2 days in jail. The judge threw out the case. But they never gave me back my teddy bears.\"</p>\n</blockquote>",
