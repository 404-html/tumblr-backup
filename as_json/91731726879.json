   "quote-text" : "The relationship between the University and the Patrician, absolute ruler and nearly benevolent dictator of Ankh-Morpork, was a complex and subtle one.<br/>\nThe wizards held that, as servants of a higher truth, they were not<br/>\nsubject to the mundane laws of the city.<br/>\nThe Patrician said that, indeed, this was the case, but they would bloody well pay their taxes like everyone else.<br/>\nThe wizards said that, as followers of the light of wisdom, they owed<br/>\nallegiance to no mortal man.<br/>\nThe Patrician said that this may well be true but they also owed a city<br/>\ntax of two hundred dollars per head per annum, payable quarterly.<br/>\nThe wizards said that the University stood on magical ground and was<br/>\ntherefore exempt from taxation and anyway you couldnât put a tax on<br/>\nknowledge.<br/>\nThe Patrician said you could. It was two hundred dollars per capita; if<br/>\nper capita was a problem, decapita could be arranged.<br/>\nThe wizards said that the University had never paid taxes to the civil<br/>\nauthority.<br/>\nThe Patrician said he was not proposing to remain civil for long.<br/>\nThe wizards said, what about easy terms?<br/>\nThe Patrician said he was talking about easy terms. They wouldnât want toknow about the hard terms.<br/>\nThe wizards said that there was a ruler back in, oh, it would be the<br/>\nCentury of the Dragonfly, who had tried to tell the University what to<br/>\ndo. The Patrician could come and have a look at him if he liked.<br/>\nThe Patrician said that he would. He truly would. In the end it was agreed that while the wizards of course paid no taxes,<br/>\nthey would nevertheless make an entirely voluntary donation of, oh, letâs say two hundred dollars per head, without prejudice, mutatis mutandis, no strings attached, to be used strictly for non-militaristic and environmentally-acceptable purposes.<br/>\nIt was this dynamic interplay of power blocs that made Ankh-Morpork such an interesting, stimulating and above all bloody dangerous place in which to live.",
