Salingerâs novel, <em>The Catcher in the Rye</em>, was published. The novel tells the story of 16-year-old Holden Caulfield, a troubled character who challenged 1950s conformity, much like Salinger himself.</p>\n<p>Due to its somewhat rebellious tone, Salingerâs work <span>has been linked to issues of controversy and censorship.Â  Even so, </span>over 60 years later, <em>The Catcher in the Rye</em> has sold over 65 million copies and continues to sell an additional 500,000 each year.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://to.pbs.org/1oYpUid\" title=\"American Masters' Infographic: The Catcher in the Rye\">Learn about the novelâs path to publication with American Mastersâ J.
