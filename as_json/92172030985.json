   "quote-text" : "Yeah, the Joker&rsquo;s ultimatum does what it&rsquo;s meant to do, which is manipulate the richest Gothamites onto a ferry. And convince Gordon to go convince Mayor Garcia that the prisoners need to get out of Gotham too, since they&rsquo;re probably part of Joker&rsquo;s plan. Of course, the fact that Gordon would be worried about the prisoners being part of Joker&rsquo;s plan is part of Joker&rsquo;s plan.",
