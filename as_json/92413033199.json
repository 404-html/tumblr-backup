Intellectually, I understood that Thor being a woman was no big deal. But, it wasnât until I saw the smile on my daughterâs face while wearing the toy Thor helmet that I GOT it. So, good on you Marvel. My little girl might be too small to get it. But other peoplesâ little girls arenât.</p>\n<p><img alt=\"image\" src=\"http://33.media.tumblr.com/3fb3cdd4ef3fe0e5ddd15e5b8754390b/tumblr_inline_n90vnbKwDn1r5cctu.jpg\"/></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Tanner texted me that photo of his bebÃ© along with most of that message yesterday, and I told him he should put it on Tumblr. Iâm so glad he did.</p>\n<p>Iâm not naive. Marvel is a comics publisher owned by a heartless megacorporation so EVERYTHING THEY DO is a ploy to sell comic books and make money.Â <span>But as far as ploys to sell comics go,Â diversifying the roster is pretty cool. And all the people Iâve worked with at Marvel have been <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9lev9739zQ\">sincerelyÂ </a></span><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9lev9739zQ\">committed</a><span><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9lev9739zQ\">Â to positive change through comics</a>Â as well as makingÂ </span><span>good art. So before you throw rocks at this, give it a shot. Itâs sincere. But if you <a href=\"http://royalboiler.tumblr.com/post/92368761288/what-are-your-thoughts-on-what-marvel-is-doing-now\">cannot bring yourself to care</a> that is also cool.</span></p>\n<p><span>AlsoÂ <a href=\"http://russelldauterman.tumblr.com/\">Russel Dauterman</a>Â and Jason Aaron are super good at their jobs.</span></p>\n<p>Plus did you see that cute baby in the Thor helmet? I know that baby. We hang out.</p></blockquote>",
