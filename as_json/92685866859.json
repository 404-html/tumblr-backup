Also, if you follow me, you know I hold all things âcreepyâ on a regular basis.</p>\n<p>â<strong>this bitch really let a venomous spider bite her trying to be cute</strong>â</p>\n<p>Apparently, Iâm a bitch?Â  And who said Linda bit me?Â  I didnât!Â  Black Widows are extremely shy and non-aggressive.Â  They are nothing to be afraid of, like any animal, if treated with respect (which usually means just leave it alone) and not threatened, they will not feel the need to defend themselves.Â  I was not âtrying to be cuteâ..Â  The point of this blog is to educate others about the natural world.Â  Me holding a venomous beneficial black widow reinforces the point- most of the negative feelings people have towards spiders are based on irrational fear.</p>\n<p>â<strong>Now they call her rotten handâ</strong></p>\n<p>Once again, youâd practically have to force a black widow to bite you.Â  Also, even if she were to bite me, it certainly would not rot my hand.Â  Black widow venom is a nuerotoxin, and does not cause necrosis.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://experiment.com/projects/spiders-of-yasuni-how-do-their-physical-traits-determine-their-lifestyle\">Spread a little love to spiders and read about my research here.</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n</blockquote>",
