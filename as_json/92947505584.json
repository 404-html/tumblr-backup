I do most of my work on one side, but every time I walk over to the other side to grab a reagent or a box of tips, I completely forget what I was after. This leads to a lot of me standing with one hand on the freezer door and grumbling, âWhat theÂ <em>hell</em>Â was I doing?â It got to where all I had to say was âEvery damn timeâ and my labmate would laugh. Finally, when I explained to our new labmate why I was standing next to his bench with a glazed look in my eyes, he was able to shed some light. âOh, yeah, thatâs a well-documented phenomenon,â he said. âDoorways wipe your memory.â</p>\n<p>Being the gung-ho new science blogger that I am, I decided to investigate. And itâs true! Well, doorways donât literally wipe your memory. But they do encourage your brain to dump whatever it was working on before and get ready to do something new. In one study, participants played a video game in which they had to carry an object either across a room or into a new room. Then they were given a quiz. Participants who passed through a doorway had more trouble remembering what they were doing. It didnât matter if the video game display was made smaller and less immersive, or if the participants performed the same task in an actual roomâthe results were similar. Returning to the room where they had begun the task didnât help: even context didnât serve to jog folksâ memories.</p>\n<p>The researchers wrote that their results are consistent with what they call an âevent modelâ of memory. They say the brain keeps some information ready to go at all times, but it canât hold on to everything. So it takes advantage of what the researchers called an âevent boundary,â like a doorway into a new room, to dump the old info and start over. Apparently my brain doesnât care that my timer has seconds to goâif I have to go into the other room, Iâm doing something new, and canât remember that my previous task wasÂ <em>antibody, idiot, you needed antibody</em>.</p>\n<p>Read more atÂ <a href=\"http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/why-walking-through-doorway-makes-you-forget/\">Scientific American</a>, or theÂ <a href=\"http://www3.nd.edu/~memory/Reprints/Radvansky%20Krawietz%20&amp;%20Tamplin%202011%20(QJEP).pdf\">original study</a>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I finally learned why I completely space when I cross to the other side of the lab, and that Iâm apparently not alone.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>this is actually kind of great and itâs nice to know thereâs something behind that constant spacing out whenever i enter a different place</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>FINALLY AN EXPLANATION</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I knew this and this is why my mom and I have called doorways âlobotomy archesâ for years</p>\n</blockquote>",
