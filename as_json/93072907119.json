My job is to find someone happily minding their own business, and mess up their happy little lives until theyâre upset enough to get off their rump and go change something. Itâs seldom a good thing in a characterâs life when the author looks at them and says, âYouâre happy, arenât you? My goodness, youâre trying to slip off into a quiet happily-ever-after! Well, donât get too comfortable my pretty, because Iâve got plans for your future.â The evil cackle is optional, of course, but I find it refreshing.",
