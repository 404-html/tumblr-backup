Instead, while Sears was traveling in China to promote his own firm&#8217;s EB-5 deal, he came to a simple realization &#8212; from industry rumbling an a look at the projectâs aggressive online marketing &#8212; that the Chicago convention center didnât smell right. Sears says this prompted him to spend 30 minutes filling out a whistleblower form on the SEC&#8217;s website. He later explained his suspicions to agency investigators. It was an easy way to make $14.7 million.",
