(The Guardian)</strong></a></p>\n\n<p>The Observer has <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/science/2014/aug/10/susan-greenfield-interview-marched-beat-drum-mind-change\">an interview with Susan Greenfield</a> this weekend. There are lots of questions it might prompt. Why, for example, has she still not answered <a href=\"http://deevybee.blogspot.co.uk/2011/08/open-letter-to-baroness-susan.html\">Dorothy Bishopâs 2011 question</a> about cause preceding effect when it comes to comments about autism, ADHD and internet use? Is the climate change analogy really all that helpful? Or why are scientists who claim to âmarch to the beat of their own drumâ always a bit annoying?</p>\n<p>But itâs hard to get to any of that. Because in the second paragraph weâre confronted with an old, clunky cliche of reporting of women in science, as the writer first feels the need to take us on a tour of the baronessâs body:</p>\n<blockquote class=\"quoted\">\n<p>The <a href=\"http://www.pharm.ox.ac.uk/research/associate/susan-greenfield\">professor of synaptic pharmacology at Oxford</a> has long, youthfully blond hair and is dressed in an above-knee pink dress and cream wedges. She tells me she plays squash as often as possible with a 21-year-old squash trainer. A remarkably fit-looking 63-year-old, she is an impressive figure in more ways than the merely professional.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This gets in the way of critically appraising Greenfieldâs work, just as it has got in the way of a robust critique and celebration of female scientists for decades.</p></blockquote>",
