As you can see from this screen shot, Wikipedia says <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/news/11015672/Wikipedia-refuses-to-delete-photo-as-monkey-owns-it.html\">no</a>: the monkey pressed the shutter so it owns the copyright.</p>\n<p>We got <strong>NPRâs in-house legal counsel</strong>, <a href=\"http://www.pearsonhighered.com/bookseller/product/A-Practical-Guide-to-Media-Law/9780205911899.page\">Ashley Messenger</a>, to weigh in. She said:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Traditional interpretation of copyright law is that the person who captured the image owns the copyright. <strong>That would be the monkey.</strong> The photographerâs best argument is that the monkey took the photo at his direction and <strong>therefore itâs work for hire</strong>. But thatâs not a great argument because <strong>itâs not clear the monkey had the intent to work at the direction of the photographer</strong> nor is it clear there was âconsiderationâ (value) exchanged for the work. Soâ¦ Itâs definitely an interesting question! Or the photographer could argue that leaving the camera to see what would happen is his work an therefore the monkeyâs capture of the image was really the photographerâs art, but that would be a novel approach, to my knowledge.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Said it before &amp; will say it again: copyright law might be the actual most interesting thing that also makes me want to punch myself in the face.</p>\n</blockquote>",
