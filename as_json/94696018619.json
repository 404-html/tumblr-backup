   "quote-text" : "âMy hands are behind my back,â I said. âIâm not resisting. Iâm not resisting.â At which point one officer said: âYouâre resisting. Stop resisting.â That was when I was most afraid â more afraid than of the tear gas and rubber bullets. As they took me into custody, the officers slammed me into a soda machine, at one point setting off the Coke dispenser. They put plastic cuffs on me, then they led me out the door. I could see Ryan still talking to an officer. I said: âRyan, tweet that theyâre arresting me, tweet that theyâre arresting me.â He didnât have an opportunity, because he was arrested as well.",
