   "quote-text" : "<p>Youâve never understood why kings scare you. Maybe itâs those crowns &#8212; jagged rims glistening like a dozen metal teeth burst forth from their  skull, a vestigial maw seeking to devour any so unfortunate to find themselves upon it. Maybe itâs their clothes &#8212; an ocean of sparkling purple silk dragged behind them like the vicious tendrils of an unholy carnivorous plant. Maybe itâs their very expression &#8212; the way it oozes that solemn, dutiful dedication to their country.</p>\n\n<p>You used to have a recurring nightmare where you were trapped in a small, dark room with a King. Thereâs no way out. No one to help you. And he just stands there, being a king. Luckily, youâve mostly taken care of your nightmare problem through heavy self-medication. Though you guess the self-medication became the bigger problem.</p>",
