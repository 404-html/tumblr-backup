   "quote-text" : "Taller buildings are trickier still. They must not block designated views of various landmarks, which explains why some of the skyscrapers in the City of London are oddly shaped. The curious wedge-shaped <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leadenhall_Building\">Leadenhall Building</a>, known as &#8220;the cheesegrater&#8221;, is intended to protect a view of St Paul&#8217;s Cathedral from a pub in Fleet Street. The design also means that the building cannot have a central concrete core, as in most skyscrapers. Instead, the floors are held up by an innovative steel exoskeleton. This makes for a thrilling journey up the buildingâs glass lifts. But it does add somewhat to the cost.",
