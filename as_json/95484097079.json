There are screams<br/>\nthat are never externalized. If I looked at the photo albums of your<br/>\npast twenty years, all I would find are decibel meter graphs of<br/>\nphone calls and the intensity of your silence as you sat <br/>\nsmoking cigarettes in the garage.</p>\n\n<p>There is a shipwreck between your ribs. You are a box with<br/>\nfragile written on it, and so many people have not handled you<br/>\nwith care.</p>\n\n<p>And for the first time, I understand that I will never know<br/>\nhow to apologize for being<br/>\none of them.</p>",
