The Legion will not tolerate an individual who endangers the lives of innocents for personal gain &ndash; let alone one who uses the Legion&rsquo;s <em>very patrol schedule</em> against them. First chance he gets, the soldier will send word to his commanding officer requesting a temporary six-hour adjustment in the patrol schedule in order to catch this vile bandit off-guard. And, if possible, additional units will be sent to patrol the road until they have apprehended this <em>Green Scourge</em> of the Gold Road. Which is a name he just made up now.",
