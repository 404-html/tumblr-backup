You probably couldnât have made it here without him, you explain, and it really means a lot to you.</p>\n\n<p>And, well, it probably sounds sappy and stupid, but most of all you kind of want to thank him for believing in you. For taking you seriously, and not just treating you like some loser Khajiit with a magic fantasy. For making it seem like you could do anything (legal) if you put your mind to it. Most people donât treat you like that.</p>\n\n<p>He tells you he was merely doing his Just and Honorable Duty by helping an Innocent Citizen in need. With any luck, his actions have made your life &ndash; and all of Cyrodiil &ndash; a Safer Place. He wishes you safe travels on the short remainder of your trip and hopes your business in Kvatch goes well.</p>",
