   "quote-text" : "This is a serious matter which I have hitherto refrained from bringing up, partly on account of its hopelessness, in the present arrangement and numbering of the species, partly because it is to some extent a question of ornithological expertness regarding which opinions may reasonbly [sic] differ. But now, having occasion to retraverse the whole ground of North American ornithology, in the preparation of the Fifth Edition of my &lsquo;Key,&rsquo; the blemish I shall point out obtrudes itself continually upon my attention; I cannot longer maintain the reticence I have hitherto preserved without seeming to condone the impropriety by tacit acquiescence; and I desire to put myself upon record in the matter, lest my silence be imputed to unrighteousness. This is the first general protest I make public on certain subjects concerning which I was often found in a more or less respectable minority of two or one, when various questions were put to vote for the official decision of the Committee over which I had for many years the honor to preside.",
