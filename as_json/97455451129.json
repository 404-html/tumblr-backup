   "quote-text" : "And the voice warned him not to attempt this peril; for his strength and skill would not be able to build any ship able to dare the winds and waves of the Great Sea for many long years yet. &ldquo;Abide now that time, for when it comes then will your work be of utmost worth, and it will be remembered in song for many ages after.&rdquo; &ldquo;I obey,&rdquo; CÃ­rdan answered, and then it seemed to him that he saw (in a vision maybe) a shape like a white boat, shining above him, that sailed west through the air, and as it dwindled in the distance it looked like a star of so great a brilliance that it cast a shadow of CÃ­rdan upon the strand where he stood.",
