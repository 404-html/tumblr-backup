It is warm-blooded and lives in northern temperate forests, using its sharp beak to hunt for birds, squirrels, and other small rodents. It is a solitary creature that is most active at night.</span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>The terrestrial octopus has a thick coat of fur and is able to climb trees and rocky outcrops using its strong arms, which are lined with mucus-secreting suction cups. Unlike its invertebrate marine counterpart, the terrestrial octopus has a skeleton, including a skull, rib cage, and vertebra-like columns of bones within each arm.</span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>During mating season, the terrestrial octopus builds, in thickets of tall vegetation, distinctive conical grass-nests in which to lay its large, speckled eggs. It will lay three to five eggs, and the incubation period lasts for thirty-five to forty days.</span><span></span></p>\n</blockquote>",
