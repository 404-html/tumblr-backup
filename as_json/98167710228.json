   "quote-text" : "1) Learn to put on your bracelets and zip up your dresses by yourself. There will be times when you will be alone.<br/>\n2) Get on a long plane ride. Look out the window. Understand the immensity of our world. Understand your insignificance. Understand your absolute importance.<br/>\n3) Press the send button. If you donât say it now, you never will.<br/>\n4) Do not sneer at happiness or roll your eyes at sadness. Be aware that apathy is not healthy.<br/>\n5) You are more than the amount of people who want to have sex with you.<br/>\n6) That pit in your stomach when he doesnât text you back, it shouldnât be there. No one should be able to control you like that.<br/> \n7) Shopping is cathartic. Buy the shoes and deal with one-ply toilet paper for a while.<br/>\n8) It will get better, but it will never be perfect. Learn to live through the small moments of happiness. When they disappear, remember they will resurface.<br/>\n9) I promise that cookie will not change anything (except that it will make you smile).<br/>\n10) Please, please, take care of yourself. You are everything to somebody. You are everything to your self. That alone is enough.",
